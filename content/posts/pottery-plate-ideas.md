What is big ideas?
Ideas are important, but they can also be dangerous. Big ideas can be so big that they become irrelevant or unimportant, and can lead to nothing more than indifference or a lack of interest in what a person has to say. But there are certain things that make for great ideas, and those things vary depending on the person. Some great examples of big ideas are:1) A new way of looking at life – This could be anything from simplifying complex concepts to coming up with a new perspective on old injustices.2) A new way of doing business – This could involve starting a company, working on a project with others, or making a change in the way people live.3) A new way of thinking about the world – This could be anything from exploring different perspectives to proposing a new perspective on an existing doctrine.

Invention history: How did some of the earliest inventions get started?
Inventions have a long and complicated history, with some getting started much earlier than others. Here are some of the most notable inventions, starting with the oldest:
The first true computer was built in the late 17th century by Johannes Gutenberg, who used a printing press to create movable type. The printing press had potential to spread literacy and knowledge far beyond the small town where Gutenberg resided.

Invention ideas are often hatched out of boredom or frustration. In 1823, Charles Babbage designed a machine that could solve problems in mathematics that had never been solved before. The machine was code-named Analytical Engine and it was not completed until 1831.

But even the earliest machines didn’t always get results they were hoping for.

The dangers of not being creative: What can go wrong if you don't focus on your potential?
Creativity is one of the most important qualities you can have in your life. It allows you to see new possibilities and come up with ideas that no one else could have thought of. However, if you don't focus on your potential, you can easily go wrong. Here are a few examples: 
1) You might not be able to come up with big ideas because you're not inspired by other people or things. 
2) You might not be able to come up with ideas that are unique or interesting because nobody has ever done them before. 
3) You might not be able to come up with great ideas because you're too timid or scared to try something new. 
4) You might not be able to come up with great ideas because your mind is too concentrated on detail instead of taking a broader view.
