What are the benefits of big ideas?
There are many benefits to big ideas, including increased creativity, innovation, and productivity. However, there are also a few key considerations that should be taken into account when creating big ideas. Here are four tips to help you create better big ideas:
1. Be clear and concise: The more information you can provide in a clear and concise manner, the easier it will be for others to understand your concept and develop a plan for implementing it.

2. Be realistic: Always be honest with your expectations and goals when developing big ideas. Don’t try to “solve everything” – instead focus on areas that can be quickly improved or neglected.

3. Get input from others: When developing your big idea, always consult with others in order to get their feedback and thoughts on the idea before moving forward.

Sometimes, ideas can be used for good, such as creating a new idea for a project, coming up with a new plan to improve upon an old one, or finding a new way to do something. Other times, ideas can be used for bad, such as inventing a new product that no one will ever buy, or coming up with a plan to fail at something.

What makes a good idea?
Ideas are important, but it's not just about ideas. It's about how you develop and pursue them that makes them truly good. Here are three tips to help you make great big ideas:
1. Do your research 
Before any big idea has a chance to grow, it's important to do your research. By understanding the industry, the competition, and what people are using or thinking of, you can create a better idea that is Tacoma-specific and relevant to your area. 
2. Be persistent 
With a good idea in mind, don't be discouraged if it doesn't quite hit home at first. Keep pushing yourself and see where things take you. Once you have a solid concept and market segmentation, you can start working on developing those details (marketing strategy, product design, etc).
