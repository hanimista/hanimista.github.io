Gadgets: How to use your new gadgets safely, making the most of your new phone or tablet, and how to take care of your batteries.
If you're a gadget lover, then you know that it's important to take care of your new devices. One way to do this is by using caution when using them. You should also be aware of the different types of batteries that are available and how to charge them safely. Here are some tips on how to use your new gadgets safely: 
1) Use the device's battery saver feature When you first get your phone or tablet, it may have an option called "battery saver." This will help extend the life of your battery by shutting off some features automatically. 

2) Keep your phone or tablet safe When you're not using it, keep your device in a safe place. This could be either a cardboard box or an envelope with padded edges.
