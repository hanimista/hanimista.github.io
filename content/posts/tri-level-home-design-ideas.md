How do we create new ideas?
Innovation is the process of creating new ideas. It can be found in everything from technology to business to creativity. Here are four ways to create new ideas:

1. Brainstorm with others: Brainstorming is a great way to get feedback and share your ideas with other people. You can also ask them for their opinion on a particular idea or topic.
2. Take on a challenge: Taking on a challenge is another way to create new ideas. Often, when you put yourself in an uncomfortable position, you’ll come up with better ideas than if you hadn’t taken the challenge.
3. Go beyond what people think is possible: Sometimes all it takes is going beyond what others think is possible to come up with better ideas.

The four steps to creating ideas: problem solving, coming up with a good title, writing a proposal, and taking action.
1. Get clear about what you want to achieve. What are your goals? What is the problem that you want to solve? 
2. Brainstorm a group of people who can help you develop your ideas. This can be a group of friends, family, or co-workers. 
3. Brainstorm a title for your project. This will give you an idea of what your project will be called and help organize all the different parts of your project together. 
4. Write out your proposal for potential investors or clients. This will give them a detailed account of what you plan to do and why it’s important for them to invest in your project.
