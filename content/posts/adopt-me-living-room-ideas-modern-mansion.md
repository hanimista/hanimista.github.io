In general, creativity refers to the ability to come up with ideas or concepts that are new and outside the norm.Creativity can have a positive impact on people and businesses, as it can help them achieve their goals. However, it can also have a negative impact, depending on the individual and the situation.

Types of Innovation: What are the different types and how do they impact business?
Innovation is a process of creating something new, often as part of an effort to improve or change an organization or industry. There are three types of innovation: incremental, disruptive, and evolutionary. Incremental innovation is when companies improve upon existing products or processes. Disruptive innovation is when a new product or service completely changes the way people do business. Evolutionary innovation refers to the gradual improvement of products and services over time.
The different types of innovation can have different impacts on businesses. Incremental innovation can lead to increased sales and profits, while disruptive innovation can lead to losses for companies that don't react quickly enough. Evolutionary innovation often results in improved customer satisfaction over time because it leads to better products that customers find more useful over time.
