The power of creative: why be creative?
Creativity is one of the most powerful tools we have at our disposal. It allows us to see the world in new ways, to find solutions to problems that might otherwise seem insurmountable, and to connect with others in a deeper way.
Some people are naturally more creative than others, but that doesn’t mean that the rest of us can’t harness our own creativity. There are a number of things we can do to nurture our creativity, including:

- Get out of our comfort zones: Challenging ourselves with new experiences and ideas helps to stimulate creativity.

- Be open-minded: Approaching life with curiosity and an open mind allows for greater creativity.

- Take risks: Creativity often requires taking risks and thinking outside the box.

So why not give it a try?

Historical Background of Invention: From ancient Greece to the American Revolution.
Invention is the act of bringing a new product to the market, or making a change in an old product so that it can be successful. It is often credited to individuals, gangs, and governments who come up with new ideas for fixing things or improving society. Invention has been a part of human history for as long as people have been able to think about it. The ancient Greeks were the first to develop inventive minds and come up with new products. They invented everything from farming tools to missiles. Inventions played an important role in the development of civilizations and the rise of republics. The American Revolution was also led by inventors, including Benjamin Franklin and John Adams.
