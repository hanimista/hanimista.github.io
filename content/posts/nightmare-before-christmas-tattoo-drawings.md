How to Organize Your Home: There are many ways to organize your home, and each one has its own advantages and disadvantages. Make sure you choose the method that is best for you.
diy ideas for organizing your home are endless, but some simple tips can make a big difference. Here are a few ideas to get you started:
1. Create separate areas for storage and use as your personal office or bedroom area. This will help you to focus on work in peace and avoid cluttering up your home with unnecessary objects.

2. Try using bins or organizers to keep important items more easily accessible. This can help you to quickly grab something if it's needed and keep track of what's where in case you lose it.

3. Get organized by creating a pegboard system according to the type of furniture in your home. For example, if you have an Ikea kitchen table, put all the cooking pots and pans on one pegboard and all the cups, spoons, measuring cups etc., on another pegboard.

2020: The year of the moon
Given that the moon is a natural satellite of Earth, it has been speculated for many years what could happen if human beings were to explore and land on the moon. And while 2020 is not necessarily the year that such a mission would be attempted, there are plenty of ideas out there for when such an endeavor could take place. Here are four examples: 
The first idea involves space travel to the moon by using a small spacecraft called Artemis. This spacecraft would be able to dock with a Russian Luna-15 spacecraft and release its astronauts in order to study the moon's surface. 
Another idea involves exploring space stations on the moon. These stations would provide research resources and rotating crews that could also conduct tasks like mining or robotic excavation. 
Lastly, we have another idea involving sending humans back down to the moon in an effort to change certain aspects of its environment.
