What is creativity?
Creativity is an essential part of any artist’s toolkit. From ideas to artwork, creativity is what allows us to express ourselves and think outside the box. Creative people often come up with new ways to approach problems or solve problems that others might not have thought of. Sometimes creativity leads to innovation or a new perspective on an old problem. The ability to be creative is something that everyone has at some point in their lives.

Overcoming creative blocks: what to do when you can't think of anything
When you feel like you can't think of anything, it can be frustrating. But there are ways to overcome creative blocks. Here are a few ideas: 
1. Take a break: Sometimes when you feel like you can't think of anything, it's because you've been thinking too hard. Step away from your work and take a break. Go for a walk, watch a movie, or read a book. Once you take your mind off of your project, you may find that the ideas start flowing again.

2. Talk to someone: When you're feeling stuck, talking to someone else can give you some fresh perspective. Brainstorm with a friend or colleague. They may have some ideas that you hadn't thought of before.
