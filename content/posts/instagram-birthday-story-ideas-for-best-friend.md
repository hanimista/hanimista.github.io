Defining Innovation
Innovation is a term that is used frequently but often left undefined. This creates confusion when discussing innovation and can lead to misunderstanding its true meaning. When speaking about innovation, one must first define it in order to have a common understanding of the topic at hand.
Innovation is typically defined as introducing something new, whether it be an idea, method, or product. However, this definition does not capture the full scope of what innovation entails. Innovation often leads to change, which can be either incremental or radical. Incremental change is small and gradual, while radical change is more significant and happens suddenly. Both types of changes are essential for innovation to occur.

There are many factors that contribute to innovation. One important factor is a company’s culture.

What are big ideas?
Big ideas are crucial to any startup or organization. They can provide the spark that ignites a new idea, or provide a way to focus on an existing problem and start solving it. By definition, big ideas are large enough to be considered as a serious possibility, but also small enough that they don’t disrupt or take over a company’s day-to-day operations. Here are three examples of big ideas that have helped startups and organizations grow:
1. Social media: A major driver of growth for startups is the ability to connect with customers on a personal level. By understanding how people use social media, companies can develop marketing strategies that work better for their target audience and create more engaging content.

2. Mobile app development: Another key element of growth for startups is creating innovative mobile apps that appeal to a wider range of users.
