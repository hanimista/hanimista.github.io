Different types of innovation:
Innovation is a key term in business. It can be defined as the process of making something new and better. There are many types of innovation, some of which are more common than others. 
One type of innovation is product innovation. This refers to the development of a new product that does not already exist. In this case, the company must come up with a new way to make their product and market it to customers.
