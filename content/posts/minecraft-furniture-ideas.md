Defining creativity
What is creativity? It’s a question that has been asked for centuries and one that still does not have a solid answer. The definition of creativity has eluded artists, scientists, philosophers, and thinkers for years. But why?
Part of the reason why it’s so difficult to define creativity is because it means different things to different people. For some, creativity is about coming up with new and innovative ideas. For others, it’s about expressing yourself in a unique and original way.

But despite the difficulty in defining it, there are some commonalities that all definitions of creativity share. Creativity is often seen as a process of turning something ordinary into something extraordinary. It’s about taking something that already exists and making it better or transforming it into something completely new.

Ideas for the environment: How can we conserve resources while still creating a healthy environment?
The future of the environment is important to all of us, and we need to find ways to conserve resources while still creating a healthy environment. Here are some ideas for the environment in 2022: 
1. Use organic materials when possible. This includes not just food, but also products made with natural ingredients. It can be tough to make this switch, but it’s worth it in the long run. 
2. Vehicle emissions need to be reduced. This will require concerted effort from both the government and businesses, but it’s something that we can achieve if we work together. 
3. Reduce energy use in homes and businesses. This can be done by retrofitting buildings or installing more efficient equipment. It’s important to take small steps rather than making drastic changes all at once, though. 
4. Foster a sustainable agriculture industry.
