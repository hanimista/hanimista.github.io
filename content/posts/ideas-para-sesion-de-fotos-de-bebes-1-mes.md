Types of Innovation:
It can be difficult to know what innovation is. For some, it’s a new technology or business model that is different from the ones currently in use. Others might call it when a company applies creativity and innovation to solve a problem or make a better product. Innovation can occur in any area of business, but some are more prevalent than others. Here are six types of innovation:
1. Procedural Innovation – This involves taking existing processes and making them more efficient or simple so they can be used by other businesses or organizations. This can include developing new methods for manufacturing products or improving how data is collected and organized.

2. Creative Innovation – This refers to using creativity and imagination to come up with novel solutions to problems or make better products. It often includes coming up with ideas that others wouldn’t think of and working tirelessly to bring them to fruition.

brainstorming: What are some creative ways to come up with ideas?
Creative ideas are the lifeblood of any business. Whether it's coming up with new ways to market your company or coming up with new products or services, creativity is key. Here are a few creative ideas to get you started: 
1. unconscious brainstorming - This technique is when you come up with ideas without knowing why or how they'll help your business.

2. using prototypes - A prototype is a version of an idea that's been created specifically for testing and feedback purposes. It can help you explore different aspects of your product before finally committed to making it a reality.
