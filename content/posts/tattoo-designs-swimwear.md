Invention is the process of coming up with new ideas and turning them into reality. It is a key part of human progress and has led to some of the most important discoveries in history. Inventors are driven by a desire to solve problems and make things better. This can be something as simple as a new way to do a task, or it can be a completely new product. The invention process often starts with an idea, which is then developed and improved upon.
