Most people would say that ideas are what give life its purpose. However, for some, ideas are what keep them up at night. For example, one person might have an idea for a new product, but never have the time or the energy to make it a reality. Others might have an idea for a new project, but feel too shy or scared to go ahead with it. Whatever the case may be, ideas are what make us human and keep us on our toes.
