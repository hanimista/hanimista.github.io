Invention, as any creative act, is the result of a collaboration of many people. From the inventor who conceived of the idea to the engineer who designed and built the product, every step in the process is essential to its success. Inventors must be able to see their ideas from start to finish, and must be able to articulate their concepts so that others can understand them.
