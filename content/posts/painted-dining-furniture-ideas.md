Topic 1: How to come up with new ideas
1. There are a number of ways to come up with new ideas. Sometimes the best way is to just think about what you've seen or heard and then come up with something new. Other times, you may have to get creative. If you're stuck, check out these resources: http://www.thespruceeats.com/new-ideas-2769464
2. It's also important to be open to new ideas if you want to keep your creativity alive. The more you're willing to try, the better off you'll be. One way to do this is by accepting that there may not be anything that fits your idea perfectly right away. That's okay! You can always tweak it until it works for you and still keep the idea interesting.

Patent applications: What are the most popular patent applications?
Patent applications are one of the most popular types of patent filings. They are used to protect ideas and inventions that may not be protected by other types of patents, like trade secret protection. 
 There are many different types of patent applications, but the most popular ones include: 
-Patent application for a new product 
-Patent application for a process or structure 
-Patent application for an invention 
There is no set number of patent applications that are filed in any given year, but it is generally safe to assume that there will be at least one type of patent application filed every month. This makes Patents a very important part of any development team as they can protect ideas and inventions from being ripped off by others.
