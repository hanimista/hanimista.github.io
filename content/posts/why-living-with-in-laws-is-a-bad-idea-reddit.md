Future of work: What will be the biggest change in the future?
One of the most important changes in the future is likely to be the growing acceptance of artificial intelligence. As machines become better at completing tasks, many jobs that once were done by human beings will be taken over by machines. This has the potential to create a massive workforce shift, with many jobs that are currently considered low-skill or manual labor becoming high-skill or computer-assisted tasks. One way to avoid this is to keep up with the latest advancements in AI technology and develop policies that ensure that every job is filled by someone who can do it well.

What is brainstroming and what does it mean for business?
What is brainstroming and what does it mean for business?
Brainstroming is a term used to describe the activity of brainstorming. Brainstorming is an effective way to come up with new ideas and solutions to problems. When done correctly, brainstroming can lead to improved business plans, strategies and operations. However, there are a few things to keep in mind when trying to achieve brainstroming success.

1) Brainstorming should be formed into teams or groups in order to provide more cohesion. This will help prevent members from working on individual projects at the same time.
2) Brainstorming should be focused on solving real-world problems rather than just coming up with new ideas. This will help your team become more knowledgeable about the problem at hand and can help you develop better solutions.
