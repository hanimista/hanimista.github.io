Definition of a big idea: What are the consequences of considering something?
Big ideas are a common feature of any innovation, whether it’s in the business world or scientific research. They can be defined in many ways, but here are a few key points:
1. A big idea is an innovative solution to a problem that has yet to be solved.

2. It must have significant implications for the world as a whole, and its potential solutions must be fully realized before it can be considered a "big idea."

3. There is typically no one-size-fits-all answer when it comes to developing a big idea, but some commonly used criteria include: novelty, impact/impactiveness, feasibility, and opportunity/opportunity cost.

What is Invention?
Invention is the process of fabricating something new from something old. It can be a simple improvement such as adding an extra layer of insulation to a sweater, or making a new product that does better than the previous one. Inventions can have big impacts on society, and sometimes they can lead to major advances in technology or business.

There are many different types of creative art, but some of the most common are painting, sculpture, film, and music.
There are many different types of creative art, but some of the most common are painting, sculpture, film, and music. While there are many great artists out there who specialize in one type of creative art, it is important to have an understanding of what the different types of creativity can do for an artist. For example, if you’re a painter and you want to create pieces featuring color and light, then you might use sculpture as your medium. However, if you’re a sculptor and you want to create pieces that are dark and moody, then you might use painting as your medium. The point is that there is no one right way to do creative art - it all depends on the artist's preferences and what they're interested in doing.

Invention is the process of designing, creating, and applying a new solution to a problem. It is a process that includes many steps, from identifying a need or opportunity, to generating ideas, to testing and refining prototypes. Invention is often driven by necessity, but it can also be sparked by curiosity or a desire to improve upon existing solutions. Whether driven by necessity or curiosity, invention requires creative thinking, perseverance, and often a willingness to fail.
