What are some benefits of coming up with big ideas?
There are many benefits to coming up with big ideas. They can help you achieve success in your business, improve your education, and even save your life. Here are a few examples:
1. When you have a big idea, you can focus on solving the problem instead of thinking about the details. This allows you to take on bigger challenges and make more progress.

2. Big ideas can often be more creative than smaller ones. This means that they may be better suited for some tasks than others, but overall they will lead to a more successful outcome.

3. Big ideas tend to be shorter and easier to write down than smaller ones. This allows you to share them with other people and get their feedback before you committing them to writing down what you have in mind.

4.big ideas tend to be less risky than smaller ones.
