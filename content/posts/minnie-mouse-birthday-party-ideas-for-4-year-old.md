Creative Process: How do you come up with invention ideas?
Invention ideas are something that can be created easily and with little effort. To come up with them, you need to have a creative process in mind. This will help you come up with new ideas that could change the way the world does business or how we live our lives. Without a creative process, it can be hard to come up with unique and interesting inventions. The following tips can help you get started:
1. brainstorming is an essential part of creative process. When you have no idea what you want to create, brainstorming will help you gather information and develop ideas.

2. take your time when brainstorming. Don’t force yourself to think of ideas right away – allow yourself some time to calm down and relax before coming up with new ones.

Creative art can be defined as any form of expression that is inspired by or has a connection to the artist's personal experiences, emotions, or ideas. It can be art in any medium, but often it is in the form of sculpture, painting, poetry, music, or architecture. Many people believe that creativity and art are two different things, but in truth, creativity and art are one and the same.

Inventors and their inventions
Inventors are people who create something new that has never been seen before. They come up with an idea, and then turn that idea into a reality. Inventions can be anything from a simple tool to a life-saving medical device.
Some of the most famous inventors in history are Leonardo da Vinci, Thomas Edison, and the Wright brothers. Da Vinci was an artist and scientist who invented many things, including the helicopter and the tank. Edison is known for inventing the light bulb and the phonograph. The Wright brothers invented the airplane.

Inventors make our world a better place. They help us solve problems and make everyday tasks easier. We owe a lot to these creative thinkers!
