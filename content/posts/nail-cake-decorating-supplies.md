There are many ways to brainstorm, but the process is always the same: you generate ideas by thinking creatively about a problem or issue. To brainstorm effectively, you need to set aside your judgment and allow yourself to come up with as many ideas as possible. Once you have a long list of ideas, you can start to narrow it down and choose the best ones. Brainstorming is a great way to come up with new ideas, solve problems, and get creative.

That’s why it’s so important to have a few ideas ready when you need them, and to keep track of what you think is potential. When you have a few ideas, it’s easier to come up with something that works and that someone will want.

Creativity in the arts: What makes art creative?
Creativity in the arts has been around for centuries, with different techniques and approaches used to achieve it. One of the key elements that makes art creative is the ability to see things differently and come up with new ideas. There are many different ways to be creative, and each one has its own strengths and weaknesses. Here are five of the most common ways artists are able to be creative: 
1. Drawing: Drawing is often seen as a passive process, with artists only using pencils and paper to create drawings. However, drawing can also be interactive, with artists using their imagination to create new drawings.

2. Painting: Painting is often seen as an active process, where artists use paintbrushes, palette knives, and other tools to create paintings. Paintings can be large or small, and they can be filled with color or without any color at all.
