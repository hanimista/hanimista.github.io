Impact of Innovation: What are some benefits to companies who embrace innovation?
Innovation is a key component of businesses that thrive. It allows companies to release new ideas and products faster, improve their efficiency and create new services or products. There are many benefits to companies who embrace innovation, but here are some of the most important: 
1. Increased Efficiency - Innovations allow companies to save time and money by productizing existing ideas or by creating new concepts that were not possible before. This can lead to increased profits and sustainability because it reduces the amount of time needed to produce a product or service.
