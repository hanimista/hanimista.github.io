The Relationship between Innovation and Creativity: How does innovation impact creativity?
Innovation has been identified as one of the key factors that have contributed to creativity. However, it is also important to consider how innovation and creativity interact. Innovation can help to increase creativity by providing new ideas and concepts, while also helping people to experiment and come up with new ways to do things.
