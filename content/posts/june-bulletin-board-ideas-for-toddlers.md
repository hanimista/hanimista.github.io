Defining creativity
In order to come up with creative ideas, one must first understand what creativity is. Creativity is the ability to come up with new and innovative ideas. It is often associated with art and music, but it can also be found in other areas of life such as problem-solving, business, and even personal relationships.
There are many different ways to define creativity. Some people believe that it is simply the ability to come up with new ideas, while others believe that it is the ability to execute those ideas in a way that is both unique and effective. Still others believe that creativity is a combination of both of these things.

Regardless of how you define it, there are certain things that are necessary for creativity to occur. These include a willingness to take risks, an open mind, and the ability to think outside the box.

The five types of ideas: analytical, creative, provisional, improvable, and suggestive
Ideas are a powerful tool for problem solving, and they can be used in many ways. Some ideas are provisional, which means they are not fully formed and may not work as planned. Other ideas may be creative, which means they are new and have no precedent. But the most common kind of idea is the provisional, which is used to come up with a solution to a problem.
