Creative process: How do inventors come up with new ideas?
Invention ideas come in many forms, but one of the key aspects of creativity is coming up with new ideas. In fact, according to a study by Vanderbilt University, more than half of new business ventures are born out of an original idea. This is why it's important for inventors to have a creative process that allows them to come up with new ideas. By following this process, they can better identify potential solutions to problems and create innovative products or services that can be successful.

Brainstroming (So what?) is a process that occurs when the brain migrates from one part of your brain to another. In some cases, this migration can be beneficial; for example, during puberty, the brain shifts from the frontal lobe to the temporal lobe. But in other cases, it can create problems. For example, if you are a math genius and want to be a financial advisor, your brain might move to the temporal lobe in order to better process numbers.

Conclusion: What is creativity and what can it do for us?
Creativity is the ability to come up with new ideas, concepts, or solutions to problems. It can be used for good or bad. The good side of creativity is that it can help us come up with new ideas, solutions, and ways to improve our lives. The bad side of creativity is that it can cause us to be creative and think outside the box, but also can lead us astray from the paths we were meant to take. Despite these risks, creativity is something that should be cherished and appreciated.
