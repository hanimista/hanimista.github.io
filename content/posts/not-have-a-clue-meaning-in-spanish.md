The Use of Invention: What are some examples?
Invention is the use of a creative idea, or a new method or process, to produce a product or service. Invention can come from anywhere: in your mind, in your backyard, on the internet, or even from someone you know. 
There are many examples of invention. For example, think about the wheel- an invention that changed the way we move around. There are also inventions that have had huge impacts on society and the world like the telephone, antibiotics, and jet engines- all of which were invented by people who were not just working on their own but were part of a team. 
Inventions can be really amazing or really terrible. But they always have a big impact because they help us do things that we couldn't do before and they make our lives easier.

Conclusion: Ideas are the lifeblood of progress
Ideas are the lifeblood of progress. Without them, we would be stuck in the same place, doing the same things, day in and day out. Ideas help us to see things in new ways, to find new solutions to old problems, and to keep moving forward.
There are a few key things to keep in mind when coming up with ideas:

1. Be open-minded. Be willing to consider all possibilities, no matter how far-fetched they may seem at first.

2. Take inspiration from others. Look at what others have done and see how you can build on their ideas or take them in a new direction.

3. Don’t be afraid to experiment. Try out different approaches and see what works best for you.
