What are big ideas?
What are big ideas? They are new and exciting ways of looking at things that may have the potential to change the way we live, work, and play. Big ideas can come from anything – a new invention, a good idea for a product, or even a new way of thinking about something.
Some big ideas might just be something you've never heard of before – like the humble computer mouse. But others might be much more familiar - like traffic congestion or how to make school smarter. It all depends on what the big idea is, and what it could bring about in terms of change.

There are many types of big ideas – some more radical than others.
