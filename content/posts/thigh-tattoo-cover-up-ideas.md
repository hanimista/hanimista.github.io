2. The sharing economy – A growing number of people are using platforms such as Airbnb and Uber to find affordable housing or transportation. This could lead to increased competition in the taxi and transport industries, as well as a rise in the cost of living.
3. Artificial intelligence – Advances in artificial intelligence are likely to enable machines to learn and become better at problem-solving than humans. This could have a significant impact on jobs and society as a whole, leading to major changes in how work is done and who has access to the best skills.
