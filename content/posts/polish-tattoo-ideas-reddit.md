Types of innovation: Product, process, market, and technology
Innovation is a key topic in business. A product, process, market, and technology that are innovative can help a company achieve success. There are many types of innovation, and each one has its own strengths and weaknesses. Here are three examples: 
Product Innovation: A product that is new and different can help a company succeed. For example, Nike's "Champion" sneakers were revolutionary because they were the first shoes to use air pressure to keep the foot elevated during exercise.

Process Innovation: Processes can be innovative too. For example, Google's search engine was revolutionary because it used natural language processing to find relevant results quickly.

Market Innovation: The market can also be innovative if it is different from what other companies offer. Apple's iPhone was the first phone to sell in billion units worldwide.

The Future of Transportation: How will transportation changes in the future?
The future of transportation is many things, but one thing it is not likely to be is a reliance on cars. In fact, many experts predict that transportation will become more diverse in the future. This means that people will no longer need to rely on just one form of transportation to get where they need to go. In fact, some experts believe that the future of transportation rests in the use of bicycles and other forms of non- motorists-powered vehicles.
