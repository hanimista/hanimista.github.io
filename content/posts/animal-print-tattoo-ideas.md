How do we come up with big ideas?
Ideas are a vital part of any business, and when it comes to big ideas, there are a few things that you need to keep in mind. First, big ideas should be purposeful and tailored to the needs of your business. You must also have a clear plan for how you will execute on them, as well as the resources necessary to make them a reality. Finally, it’s important to remember that big ideas often require more than one person or even several teams to come up with them. As such, always be prepared to listen and learn from others who may have experience working on large projects.

Exercise: How to be creative in your everyday life
Creativity is a key word in everyone’s vocabulary. Whether you are a creative artist, graphic designer, or just someone who enjoys making things, creativity is important to have in your everyday life. There are so many ways to be creative and put your creativity into use every day- from taking risks with new ideas to using your creativity to solve problems. Here are five tips on how you can become more creative in your everyday life: 
1. Take risks: If you are afraid of anything, it will limit your creativity. Be brave and try something new- it might not work out, but at least you will have tried and that will help you learn more about yourself and what makes you feel successful. 
2. Use your imagination: The more fun you can have when thinking about ideas, the more likely you will be to come up with new ones.
