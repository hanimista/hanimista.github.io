The future of transportation
The future of transportation is packed with potential. Some of the ideas being floated include: driverless cars, totally autonomous transportation, and even flying cars. All of these projects have a lot of potential to improve our quality of life and save us money in the long run. But how do you go about making these ideas a reality? And what are some early steps that could help make them a reality? Here are four tips: 
1. Start with small steps 
If you want to see large-scale transportation projects take off, it’s important to start with small steps. This means taking things like creating bike lanes or getting single-occupancy vehicles registered on the road. It also means looking at ways to reduce congestion and improve safety. 
2. Get involved in community deliberations 
Community deliberations are key in helping to create successful transportation projects.
