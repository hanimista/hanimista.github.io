Creativity in art: How can it be used?
Creativity in art can be used in a variety of ways, from creating new and original pieces to exploring old ideas and techniques. There are a number of different methods that creative artists use to express themselves, and it ultimately depends on what the artist is looking for. Some common ways to utilize creativity in art include:
1. Drawing inspiration from nature – often times, artists will take inspiration from things that they see around them or feel inside themselves. This can involve looking at photos or drawings as a way to start thinking about how they could create a piece based on what they see.

2. Experimenting with materials and techniques – many times, creative artists will try out new materials or techniques in order to see what works best for them.

Brainstroming: How does it work?
How do brains work? There is no one answer to this question as the workings of the brain are complex and still being studied by scientists today. But, according to some theories, brainstroming may play a role in some aspects of mental activity. Brainstroming is when thoughts or ideas rush through your mind quickly and without any thought process behind them. This can lead to a lot of thinking and problem solving in a short amount of time. In some cases, brainstroming can be helpful for quick bursts of creativity or for focusing on a task at hand. However, it can also be dangerous if used too frequently or without proper moderation. So, how does brainstroming work? Scientists don’t really know for sure, but some theories suggest that it involves the release of chemicals from your brain in order to help you process information more quickly.

legal aspects of Invention: What are the rules surrounding invention?
Invention is a process of coming up with a new idea,product or method. It can be defined in many ways, but the most common definition is that invention is "the creation of something new out of nothing." Many countries have laws that regulate the creation and use of inventions. In some cases, these laws are more important than others, and they can play a decisive role in whether an invention becomes a commercial success.
There are three types of law governing invention: trade secrets, copyrights and patents.trade secrets usually relate to technology or business ideas, while copyrights protect creative works such as novels, motion pictures and computer programs. Patents allow inventors to exclusive use their ideas for a period of time, which can make it difficult for other people to adopt or use an invention.
