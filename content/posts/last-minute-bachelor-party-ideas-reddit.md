New ideas are always exciting, and with the current economy, it is even more important to have new ideas on how to improve things. One example of a new idea is having an online reservation system for restaurants. This would allow customers to reserv seats online before they come in, which would save them time and money. Another idea would be increasing the number of dining options in town. This would make it easier for people to find what they are looking for when they are out for dinner.
