The history of art: From prehistoric paintings to Post-Impressionism
Creative art has been around for as long as humans have been able to create. Prehistoric paintings and drawings depict everyday life and natural scenes, some dating back as early as 3,000 BC. Post-Impressionism was a movement in the late 19th century that aimed to update and renovate the French art movement of the 18th century. While many aspects of creative art have remained consistent over time, there are certain changes that can be seen in every genre.
