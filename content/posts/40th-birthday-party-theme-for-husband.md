I was born in 1984, and I'm now a Sophomore at Stanford University in California. My parents were both Scientists. My father is a Scientist and my mother is a Engineer. I always loved Science because it was the only thing that was constant in my life. When I was younger, I would watch molecule-by-molecule movies and take detailed notes on what everything looked like. This led to me wanting to become a Scientist myself one day.

What are big ideas?
When it comes to big ideas, there are many dimensions to consider. These can be broken down into four categories: problem, solution, opportunity and impact. 
Problem: How can we make our world a better place? 
Solution: There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question; each person's perspective and situation will dictate the best way to solve a problem. However, there are a few general concepts that can be used in order to determine what type of solution may work best for a given situation. One such concept is called the "Golden Rule." This states that you should do what is right, even if it doesn't make sense at first. 

Opportunity: What are the possible consequences of our actions? 

Impact: What kind of change or impact will our solutions have?
