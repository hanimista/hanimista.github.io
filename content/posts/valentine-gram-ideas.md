2020: How do we make sure that our 2020 election is fair?
In 2020, the United States will face another harsh election season. Key issues that will be debated include how to make sure that the election is fair and what measures can be taken to prevent fraud. Here are four ideas for making sure that the 2020 election is fair: 
1. Create a public database of all registered electors in order to help ensure accuracy and transparency. This would help reduce voter fraud and make it easier for voters to check whether their ballot has been cast correctly. 
2. Increase the number of voting machines from precincts to whole neighborhoods so that more people can vote in one voting place rather than scattered throughout various precincts. This would improve security and ensure that all ballots are counted accurately. 
3. Make it easier for citizens with disabilities to vote by offering identification requirements or waiving residency requirements in certain cases.

Examples of creative thinking in business
Creativity is a critical component of business. In fact, creativity is seen as one of the most important skills for businesses to possess. There are a number of ways businesses can use creativity in their operations and this column will explore an example from a logistics company. 
A logistics company is responsible for moving goods around the country. They need to come up with ideas for avoiding congestion and getting the products to their customers on time. One way they do this is by coming up with new ways to package products and get them to customers faster.

One idea they came up with was using 3D printing technology to create custom boxes for each product. This would allow them to print boxes that would be specific to the product and meet the customer's needs exactly.
