The Idea: 1. What are some big ideas?
There are a few big ideas out there when it comes to starting a business. Here are some of the most prominent:
1. Start small and grow large. This is one of the most important things to remember when starting a business. You don't have to be the biggest or best in the world just start something and see where it takes you.
2. Be passionate about what you do. If you're not passionate about your work, no one else will be either. This is something that will come with time and experience, but start off by putting your all into your startup and showing people that you're really into it.
3. Have repeat customers/clients come back for more.

Creative Solution: How do I come up with creative ideas?
Creative solutions come in all shapes and sizes, but the key is to find the right one for your needs. Here are a few tips for coming up with creative ideas:
1. Get inspired by other projects you’ve worked on. When you see creative solutions that are similar to yours, it can be easy to come up with ideas. This way, you won’t have to spend hours brainstorming until you find the right solution.

2. Be open to new ideas. It can be hard to be creative when everything else around you is familiar and cookie-cutter. But don’t be afraid to submit new ideas if they seem interesting or if someone else has already created a similar solution.

3. Take your time. Don’t get wrapped up in too much hurry when it comes to coming up with creative solutions.
