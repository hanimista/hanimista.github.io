Brainstroming is the process of focusing on a certain topic and coming up with great ideas for solving a problem. This can be done through brainstorming, thinking outside the box, or simply looking at things from a different perspective. Brainstroming can be very helpful when it comes to solving problems, and it's something that should be used more often in business and engineering.

How to come up with big ideas: What tips do you have?
Big ideas are the lifeblood of any business. Without big ideas, businesses risk becoming stagnant or even failing. Here are a few tips to come up with big ideas: 
1. Brainstorm with others: Brainstorming is key to coming up with great ideas. Talk to your accountant, banker, or other important professionals about what you want to achieve. They can provide guidance on how to make your idea a reality. 
2. Use brainstorming tools: With brainstorming tools like Scrum, Kanban boards, and Venn diagrams, you can quickly generate potential solutions and understand the different aspects of your problem. 
3. Be open to change: Sometimes it’s best to be flexible when it comes to coming up with big ideas. Don’t be afraid to experiment and see what works best for your business model and product.

Limitations of innovation: What are some common limitations to innovation?
The challenges of innovation are well known, but how often do we take the time to understand the limitations of innovation? These limitations can stem from a number of factors, including historical precedent, cultural norms, financial resources, and other constraints.
There are a few key limitations to innovation that should be taken into account when seeking new ideas or concepts:

1. Limitations on creativity: Innovation often comes with a risk of becoming boring or incremental. When trying to come up with new ideas, it is essential to be creative and innovative. However, not all innovations are capable of achieving this level of creativity. In fact, many innovations fall victim to this limit because they lack the ability to surprise or dazzle the audience. This can make it difficult for customers and employees to accept an innovation as new and different than what they have been used to before.
