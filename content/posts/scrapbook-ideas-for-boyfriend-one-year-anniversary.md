What are big ideas?
Big ideas are important, and they can help spur new thought and innovation. Here are some of the most common big ideas:
1. We can all be more creative. big ideas can come from anywhere, but creativity is often found in the imagination. The more we can tap into our creativity, the better we'll be able to think of new ways to improve things.

2. There's no one right way to do something. Just because something seems impossible or impossible-minded, that doesn't mean it isn't possible or reasonable to try out for a change. A big idea is just a suggestion - so try out different ideas until you find the one that works best for you and your situation.

3. Disruptive innovation is key to success in any industry.

Conclusion: Are there any drawbacks to having ideas? How can you overcome them?
Ideas are a great way to think about new ideas and come up with new ways to do things. However, there are some drawbacks that can occur when having ideas. The first drawback is that it can be difficult to come up with all of the details needed for an idea to take off. This can lead to a lack of confidence in your idea and a less likely chance of seeing it through to the end. Another drawback is that ideas can be very time-consuming and require a lot of effort from you and others involved in the project. This can lead to feeling overworked or undervalued when it comes time for the idea to actually be implemented.

There are so many ways to think about ideas, and each has its own strengths and weaknesses. One way to approach brainstorming is to come up with a few specific ideas that you can work on. Once you’ve chosen a few, begin to think about what implications each one might have. Once you’ve come up with a few rough drafts, it’s time to test them out and see what works best for your story.
