The definition of creativity
Creativity is a wide and undefined term that can mean many different things to many different people. To some, creativity means experiencing new ideas, coming up with new ways to do things, or simply having fun. To others, creativity means being able to come up with solutions to problems or coming up with unique ideas that other people might not have thought of. There is no right or wrong answer to this question as what matters most is how you use creativity in your life.
