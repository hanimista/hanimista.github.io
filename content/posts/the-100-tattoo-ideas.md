Why are big ideas important?
When it comes to big ideas, there are two types: the great ones and the impossible ones. Great ideas are those that have the potential to change the world, but they also come with a lot of risk. Only then can they be abandoned or even reconsidered, as is the case with Google’s Street View. Impossible ideas are those that are so outlandish and out of reach that no one has yet proposed them. This is why big ideas need to be considered carefully before being implemented, just as with any other idea.

Diy Ideas For The Busy Person
You're always busy and don't have time for anything. But what if we told you that there are benefits to Diy-ing? Yes, it's true! Here are three benefits of taking on a Do It Yourself project:

1. It can save you money. When you do things yourself, you don't have to pay someone else to do it for you. This means that you can put that money towards something else - like your savings or retirement account.

2. It can be therapeutic. Doing something with your hands can be very calming and satisfying. It can help take your mind off of your stressful day-to-day life and give you a sense of accomplishment when you finish a project.

3. It can be a bonding experience.
