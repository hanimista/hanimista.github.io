How to develop big ideas
The art of big ideas is key to any business. The ability to come up with original and exciting concepts that can help your company grow is what makes the business world so fascinating. Here are a few tips on how to develop big ideas:
1. Don’t be afraid to ask for help – There’s no shame in asking for help from outside of your company if you don’t have an idea that seems impossible. If you have a great idea, but don’t know where to start, speak with friends, family, or colleagues about your idea. They may have some great advice on how to get started.

2. Get organized – Once you have a good idea, it helps to organize it in some way so that you can better focus on developing it.

Idea for a big goal: What is our biggest goal?
Big goals are powerful tools for getting people to work together and achieve common goals. They can help a team focus on its mission, and create a sense of purpose. 
There are many different ways to create big goals, but here are five tips for creating effective ones: 

1. Start small: Big goals can be created relatively easily if the goal is something that the team is focused on and knows it has a chance of achieving. However, if the goal is something more difficult or time-consuming, it may be more difficult to get everyone together around it. Try starting with something that everyone in the team can understand and achieve. 

2. Break it down: Once the goal has been identified, break it down into smaller tasks that each team member can complete successfully.

Waste Management: How do you deal with waste when completing a DIY project?
Do you have any extra materials or tools that you don't need and could use on a future project? Do you have old clothes, furniture, or other materials that you don't want to throw away but can't seem to get rid of? If so, there are a few ways to deal with waste when completing a DIY project. 
One way is to bin the material and put it in a landfill. This option is often cheaper and takes less time than dealing with the waste physically. Another option is to recycle the material. This process involves sorting the material by type (paper, plastics, metal) and then putting it into appropriate jars or sacks. The recycling process can take weeks or even months, but it is usually cheaper than trying to get rid of the material physically.
