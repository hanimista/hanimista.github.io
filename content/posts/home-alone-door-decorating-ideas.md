The State of Invention Today
Invention is a vital part of our economy and society. Yet, it has been difficult to keep up with the growth of invention. Inventions have become more common, but the number of new ideas remains low. This lack of innovation is costing society billions of dollars each year in lost revenue and jobs.
Despite these costs, there is still a lot that we can learn from the history of invention. For example, some inventions were originally created for no other purpose than to solve a problem. Other inventions were made just for fun or as an experiment. But even the simplest inventions can have big consequences. For example, the Telephone was invented to make communication more efficient and cost-effective. Today, it plays an important role in our lives and economy.

There are several ways to help rise awareness about Invention and keep it alive.

The different types of innovation: Research, invention, development, and production
Innovation is a process of making something new or different. There are three main types of innovation: Research, Invention, and Development.
Researchinnovation is the most common type of innovation. It's when people study something and then make a change to it so that it can be used in the future. For example, in the medical field, researchers study diseases and then develop treatments to help people with them.

Inventionis when someone comes up with a new idea for something and then does something with it to make it work. For example, somebody might come up with a new way to make cigarettes that doesn't use tobacco smoke as part of their product. 

Developmentis when somebody makes an idea into a reality by creating a product or service that is usable by people.
