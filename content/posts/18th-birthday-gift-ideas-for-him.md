1st idea:
Ideas are the lifeblood of any business. Without fresh ideas, businesses would quickly become stagnant and fail to thrive. Though generating new ideas can be challenging, it is essential for businesses to keep the flow of ideas going in order to stay relevant and succeed.
There are a few ways to generate new ideas. One way is to hold brainstorming sessions with employees. This gets everyone in the company thinking about new possibilities and can often lead to some great concepts. Another way to come up with new ideas is to look at what other businesses in your industry are doing and try to improve upon it. Finally, don’t be afraid to think outside the box – sometimes the best ideas come from left field.

If you want your business to stay ahead of the competition, it is imperative that you generate new ideas on a regular basis.

The role of invention in society: What are the biggest uses for innovation in society today?
Innovation has long been a key component of society. From the development of new technology to the improvement of food production, innovation has always been essential in order to keep society running smoothly and ensuring that everyone has access to the basics. 
However, there are a number of other spheres in which innovation can be used in society. For example, innovations in healthcare could lead to better treatments for patients and lessened costs; or innovations in transportation could make it easier for people to reach their destinations safely and efficiently. 

There is no one answer to whether or not innovation is important in society, but it is worth looking at how it can be used in different ways in order to ensure that everyone benefits from its impact.
