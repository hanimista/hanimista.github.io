Creative process: How do you go about creating something new?
Creative process is how do you go about creating something new? There are many ways to approach creative endeavors, but one of the most common and effective ways is to start with a blank slate. This allows you to focus on your idea and not worry about what others might think or say. It can also be helpful to have a specific goal in mind before starting the creative process. Once you have your idea down, it’s time to start writing! The best way to come up with good ideas is by brainstorming with other people. This will help you come up with new concepts and ideas that could work on paper. Once you have some good ideas, it’s time to start working on them! You can use any method or tool that works for you while working on your project. Whether it’s a computer, pencil, paper, or even your creativity!

How to start: What are some basic steps for beginning DIY projects?
Do you want to start a new project but don't know how to start? or maybe you've been working on a project for awhile and don't feel like starting again? Here are some basic steps for beginning DIY projects:
1. Decide what you want your project to be. This could be anything from fixing a leaky faucet to building a new wardrobe. 
2. Find the tools you need and an area where you can work. If you're starting from scratch, it might help to have a few items in your toolbox like clamps, screwdrivers, drill drivers, and nails (or screws if you're using Lowe's or other Home Depot stores). 
3. Determine the size of your project. Again, this could be anything from fixing a leaky faucet to building a new wardrobe.
