What are some new ideas?
Some new ideas for healthy eating come in all shapes and sizes. Some people might just want to start incorporating more fruits and vegetables into their diets, while others might prefer whole grains or proteins. Whatever your preference, here are five healthy ideas to get you started: 
1) Try a plant-based protein shake instead of meat or chicken protein. Plant-based proteins are high in fiber and nutrients, which can help you feel fuller longer. 
2) Eat more vegetables and fruit as part of your breakfast and lunch. Vegetables contain seeds, which is a good source of fiber and other nutrients. When you eat them early in the morning or before lunch, you’re less likely to feel hungry later in the day. 
3) Make sure to add watercress to your diet whenever possible.

Big thinking is about more than just coming up with big ideas. It’s also about having the courage to act on those ideas, even when they seem impossible. After all, it was a big thinker who said, “The impossible just takes a little longer.
