What makes a good idea?
Every idea has a differentiator and what makes a good one is always subjective. Some people might find the concept interesting, others might not. There are many factors to consider when choosing an idea, such as how well it will be executed, who will be using it, and whether it is something that users are already passionate about. 
One of the most important things to consider when coming up with ideas is whether or not they are big enough to warrant investment. If an idea is too small or unimportant to warrant attention, it will likely be forgotten or passed over. A good example of this was the iPhone app Gap which was only released in Australia but contained massive potential because users were already interested in fashion and had tonnes of feedback. Another example would be Square which was originally considered a payment platform but has since become a popular social media platform for businesses and individuals.
