Defining Innovation
Innovation is a term that is used frequently but its meaning can be difficult to define. When asked to define innovation, most people will give a general and vague answer. The true definition of innovation is much more specific.
Innovation can be defined as the process of taking an idea or concept and turning it into a reality. It is the implementation of a new or improved solution that solves a problem or meets a need. Innovation involves creativity, but it also requires resourcefulness, planning, and execution.

There are many different types of innovation, but all share one common goal: to make something better. Whether it’s a new product, process, or service, innovation strives to improve upon what already exists. Sometimes this means coming up with an entirely new solution, and other times it means making small improvements to existing solutions.

Patent trends: What are some of the latest patent trends?
Patents are a valuable source of intellectual property. They can protect your ideas and inventions from being copied or used without your permission.

1. Inventor protection claims are getting more common. 
2. Patent applications are coming in larger numbers, and they're more complex than ever before. 
3. The number of patents granted is also increasing, but there's still a lot of competition for the same rights and permissions. 
4. There's a growing trend of using Previously Unpublished Data (PUD) in patent applications. This allows inventors to use data that they've already filed with other companies but which they haven't been able to disclose until now.
