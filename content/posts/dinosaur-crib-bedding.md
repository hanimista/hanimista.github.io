Overcoming Writer's Block: What to do when you can't seem to come up with anything.
When you sit down to write and nothing comes to mind, it can be frustrating. Here are a few ideas to help you overcome writer's block and start getting your thoughts down on paper.
First, take a break. Sometimes when you've been staring at a blank page for too long, your brain just needs a break. Get up and walk around, do something else for a little while, and then come back to your writing with fresh eyes.

Second, try brainstorming. Get a piece of paper and write down whatever comes to mind, no matter how silly or unrelated it may seem. Once you have a long list of ideas, you can start narrowing them down and figuring out which ones you want to explore further in your writing.
