Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea, or a new way of doing something. It can be anything from a simple improvement to an entire new product. In some cases, inventions come about as a result of chance meetings or shared interests. Other times, inventors spend years planning and working on their ideas until they have a real plan for making their invention a reality.
