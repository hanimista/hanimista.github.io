Brainstorming with a team
1. When it comes to brainstorming with a team, there are a few things to keep in mind.
2. First and foremost, it’s important to create an environment where everyone feels comfortable sharing their ideas. This means no judgement or criticism – just open-mindedness and respect for others’ opinions.

3. Secondly, try to come up with a structure for the brainstorming session beforehand so that it runs smoothly and efficiently. This could involve setting time limits for each topic, or having specific questions that you want to focus on.

4. Finally, don’t forget the power of visual aids! If you can find a way to visualize your team’s ideas, it will help everyone to better understand and remember them later on.

The art of creativity: What artists do and why they do it
Creativity is a wide and varied term, but it typically refers to the ability of artists to produce new works of art. This can be in the form of paintings, sculptures, photography, etc. but also in the form of ideas or concepts that are not necessarily physical. In many ways, creativity is an innate quality that all humans possess. It is something that is passed down from one generation to the next and something that can be cultivated through practice and hard work. While some people may find creativity a challenge to achieve, for others it can be a source of inspiration and guidance.
