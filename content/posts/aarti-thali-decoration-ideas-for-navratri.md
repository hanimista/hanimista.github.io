The downside of creativity
Creativity has been shown to have many benefits, both for individuals and society as a whole. However, there are also some potential downsides to being too creative.
For example, people who are very creative may be more likely to experience mental health problems such as anxiety and depression. This is because they are constantly thinking outside the box and questioning everything, which can lead to feeling overwhelmed and stressed out.

In addition, creative people may have a hard time fitting in with others. This is because they often see the world differently and have trouble relating to others who think more conventionally. As a result, they may feel like they don’t belong or are misunderstood.

While creativity has its advantages, it’s important to be aware of the potential drawbacks as well.

How to Come up with Creative Ideas
Creative ideas are a dime a dozen, but it can be hard to come up with them. There are a few things that help: having an idea, brainstorming, testing, and iteration. 
Here are some tips for coming up with creative ideas:

1. Brainstorm - Brainstorming is key to coming up with new ideas. Start by thinking about the problem you want to solve and how you can improve on what's already out there. What are the possible solutions? 
2. Test - Once you've generated some brainstorm fodder, it's time to test it out. Do something different or innovative with it and see if it works or not. This will help you get a better understanding of how your idea works and what problems might need to be solved in order for it to work well.
