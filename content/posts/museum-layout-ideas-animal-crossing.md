conclusion
This is the conclusion of an article on big ideas. 
There are many different types of big ideas, but this roundup provides a few key takeaways. First, big ideas can be helpful in problem solving and coming up with new ways to do things. They also can help us think outside the box and come up with novel solutions to problems we’re familiar with. 
 Second, it’s important to be able to articulate big ideas clearly and convincingly so that others will want to hear them. This is where creativity and speaking confidently comes into play. Finally, it’s essential to keep in mind that big ideas should only be used as a starting point for new thinking; they should not become our full-time job.

1. Use the Right Tools and Materials
Tools play an essential role in any DIY project, but it is especially important to use the right tools for the job.

Conclusion: How do you wrap up your DIY projects?
If you're like most people, wrapping up your DIY projects is a key part of the success of completing them. Here are some tips to help make it a breeze:
1) Shred or cut everything before you start. This will help keep things organized and make it easier to wrap up.
