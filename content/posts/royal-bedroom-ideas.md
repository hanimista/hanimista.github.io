1. Get a business idea. A business idea can come from anything that you think could be profitable or interesting. It doesn't have to be something you're already familiar with, either. Go online and search for phrases like "business ideas for young entrepreneurs" or "business ideas for people with disabilities."
2. Start a business with friends or family members. This is one of the best ways to get started because it's low-cost and easy. Ask your parents, your siblings, or your friends if they know anyone who might be interested in starting their own business. You can also start a business through a website or an online course.
