There are a number of ways to create big ideas, but some are easier than others. One approach is to come up with a concept that youâ€™re passionate about and then explore what others have said about it.

Whatever method you choose, remember that big ideas are worth pursuing â€“ no matter how challenging or difficult they may seem at first.
