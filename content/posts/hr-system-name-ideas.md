The power of creativity: How can creativity help you achieve success?
Creative ideas can help you achieve success in any field. Whether you are a artist, writer, or businessperson, creativity can help you achieve your goals. Here are five ways to use creativity to your advantage: 
1. Take on new challenges – When you take on new challenges, you increase your chances of succeeding. For example, if you are a creative writer, try writing stories that are unusual or challenging. You may find that your skills improve as you work on these projects. 

2. Use technology – Technology has the ability to help us reach our goals faster and more efficiently than ever before. For example, if you are an artist, consider using online tools to create paintings or sculptures quickly and easily. This way, you can enjoy the process of creating rather than having to wait for turnaround times for your product or service.
