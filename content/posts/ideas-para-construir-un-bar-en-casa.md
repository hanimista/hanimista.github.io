Development: How do you actually develop an invention idea?
When it comes to developing an invention idea, the best way is to do some research and figure out what you want to create. If you have a specific problem that you want to solve, then brainstorm a few possible solutions. However, if you don't know what you're looking for or if you just don't have any ideas, then brainstorming won't help. The best way to come up with an invention idea is by doing some tinkering and experimenting. Once you've had a few prototypes created, it's time to start turning them into a product. By doing this, you'll be able to see how people use your product and see where potential problems might exist.

What is invention?
Invention is the process of creating something new from an old idea. Invention can be anything from a simple improvement to a completely new product. 
There are many types of inventions, but the most common ones are products and services. Products are things that people use or want, while services are those that people give or receive. 

Invention can come in many forms, but it's usually determined by whether the invention is practical or not. Practicality is important because if an invention is impractical, people may not be able to use it or might not have the same reaction that they would if they did have the idea first. 

There are many different types of inventions, but one of the most common is the invention of a product. A product is something that someone uses or wants and it has a specific purpose or use.
