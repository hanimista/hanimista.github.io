Invention processes: What happens during the invention process?
Invention is the process that occurs during which a new idea or invention is created. This can be done through the creation of a new product, service, or idea. Inventions can also come about through the research and development of a new product. While both processes are essential to the success of an invention, they are also different. 
The invention process typically involves three steps: ideation, development, and commercialization. Ideation happens when an inventor has a great idea for a product or service and it doesn't yet have a name or prototype. Development happens when the inventor comes up with a working prototype of their product or service. Commercialization happens when someone decides to make their product or service available to the public. 

While all three steps are important, they each have their own importance.

Exploring the unconscious mind in creative people: How does the subconscious contribute to creativity?
Creative people often have a higher level of awareness and are better equipped to see connections between ideas and the world around them. This can lead to new and more thought-provoking ways of looking at things, which in turn allows them to be more creative. However, it's not just the conscious mind that is responsible for creativity - the unconscious mind also plays a part. The unconscious mind is made up of hidden thoughts, feelings, and memories that we don't usually consider. It's where our creative potential lies - it's where we store all our ideas, inspiration, and dreams. Exploring the unconscious mind in creative people can help them become more aware of their own power and potential to be creative. By understanding how the subconscious helps us to be more creative, they can use their creativity to achieve their goals.
