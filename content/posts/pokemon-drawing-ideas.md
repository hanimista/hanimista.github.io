In a world that is constantly changing and evolving, it is more important than ever to have big ideas. Big ideas have the power to change the world, and they often start with just one person.
If you have an idea that you think could make a difference, donâ€™t be afraid to share it with others. You never know who might be inspired by your idea and help turn it into a reality.

Some of the most influential people in history have been those who had big ideas. So donâ€™t let anyone tell you that your idea is too small or too crazy â€“ it just might be exactly what the world needs.

The history of creative art: How does it start?
Creative art has a long and complex history, with different people and cultures contributing to its creation. One of the earliest examples of creative art was considered to be cave art, which was discovered in France in the late 1800s. This type of art involved artists creating pieces out of natural materials such as flint and obsidian. It is thought that these artists used their creativity to escape from reality and explore their inner world. From there, other forms of creative art began to emerge, including sculpture and painting. While both types of art have their own unique strengths, they are united by the fact that they are created using inspiration and ideas from outside of the artistâ€™s own experience.
