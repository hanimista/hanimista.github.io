Creative expression: The creative act and the creative media
Creative expression is the process of coming up with new ideas, expressing them through creative means and then sharing these ideas with others. The creative act involves the individual’s thoughts, feelings and creativity as well as the medium through which they are expressed. The creative media includes both tangible and intangible forms, such as art, music, motion pictures and television. As we learn to express ourselves more creatively, we also learn to create more effectively in order to improve our businesses, relationships and lives.
