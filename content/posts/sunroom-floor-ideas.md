Business models: What are some innovative business models?
Invention ideas can be anything from a new product to a new business model. Here are some of the most innovative business models in the world:
1. The sharing economy: This is a model where people trade goods and services for each other. It is growing rapidly, with companies like Uber and Airbnb following suit.

2. The data-collection industry: This is a model where businesses collect data about their customers in order to sell them products or services. Datacollection has become increasingly important in today’s economy, as more and more companies need to know how their customers are interacting with them.

3. The crowdfunding industry: This model takes advantage of the generosity of people who want to support a project but don’t have enough money available to do so.

Outlook: What do you think the future of technology holds for our industry?
As the world becomes increasingly connected, technology is changing the way businesses operate. Some of the biggest changes include the rise of online shopping and the increasing use of mobile devices. As this change takes place, many companies are looking to adapt their strategies in order to survive. 
One company that has been adapting quickly is Microsoft. The Redmond-based company has long been a leader in software and hardware development, but it's now focusing its efforts on developing “big ideas” that could have a significant impact on business. 

Microsoft has been working on a number of projects that could have a major impact on the future of technology. One project is called Project Apollo, which is focused on developing a new type of computer memory known as Accelerated Persistent Memory (APM).

Idea Generation: How do you generate new ideas?
Creative ideas are a dime a dozen, but there’s something about generating new ones that makes them stand out. If you can come up with an interesting and innovative idea, your next project will be much more successful. Here are 5 tips to help you generate fresh ideas:
1. Take a step back and think about what you want to achieve. When you come up with an original idea, it’s important to focus on what the product or service could do for someone else. What problems could it solve? Who would be interested in using it?

2. Be persistent and keep exploring. Don't give up if your first suggested solution isn't perfect. Keep trying until you find the right combination of ideas and resources that work for you and your business.

3. Talk to people who use the product or service regularly.

Types of creativity: Mental, physical, emotional, spiritual.
Creativity is an intangible quality that can be described in many ways. Mental creativity, for example, refers to the ability to come up with new ideas or solutions quickly and without thought. Physical creativity, on the other hand, refers to the ability to move your body and make physical changes in order to create new ideas or solutions. Emotional creativity, on the other hand, refers to the ability to feel positive emotions such as happiness, joy, joyfulness, and contentment. Spiritual creativity refers to the ability to connect with God or another higher power and come up with new ideas or solutions.
