What are the benefits of having ideas?
Ideas can be a powerful tool for problem solving. They can also help you create new ideas and drive new thoughts. The following are some of the benefits of having ideas: 
1. You get more done. When you have many ideas, your mind is more open and able to think of potential solutions. 
2. You learn more quickly. When you have a lot of ideas, you can learn from them and make better decisions faster than if you only had a few choices to make. 
3. You are more creative. Ideas are what allow us to come up with new solutions to problems and come up with novel ways to do things that we never thought of before. 
4. You save time and money.
