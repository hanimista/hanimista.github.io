The Use of Invention: What are some examples?
Invention is the use of a creative idea, or a new method or process, to produce a product or service. Invention can come from anywhere: in your mind, in your backyard, on the internet, or even from someone you know. 
There are many examples of invention. For example, think about the wheel- an invention that changed the way we move around. There are also inventions that have had huge impacts on society and the world like the telephone, antibiotics, and jet engines- all of which were invented by people who were not just working on their own but were part of a team. 
Inventions can be really amazing or really terrible. But they always have a big impact because they help us do things that we couldn't do before and they make our lives easier.

Product/Service sections: What problems do you think need to be solved in order to make a better product or service?
There are a number of things that need to be solved in order to make a better product or service. One area where new ideas could help is in the area of customer service. Many people feel that the service that they receive when purchasing a product is not up to par and this is especially true when it comes to online services. This problem needs to be addressed in order for people to feel confident with their purchase. Another issue that needs to be solved is with the way products are offered. It can be difficult for customers to figure out what they are buying, especially when it comes to digital products. A solution could be to offer more information on each product, as well as give customers the ability to return any product if they are not satisfied.

Conclusion: What is creativity? What differentiates it from other abilities and how can it be used to create successful outcomes?
Creativity is the ability to come up with new ideas, formulations and plans that are not always easy to come by. It’s a process that starts with the brainstorming session and continues until the final product is created. It can be used for good or bad outcomes, but creativity has a key advantage; it allows individuals to take risks and think outside the box.

How to come up with new invention ideas: What are some steps to take when coming up with new invention ideas?
inventions are constantly being made and updated, so it's important to come up with new ideas for them as often as possible. Here are some steps to take when coming up with new invention ideas:
1. Determine what you want your invention to do. This can be difficult, but it's important to think about the potential benefits of your product or service before beginning development.

2. Consider who would be interested in your product or service. What are the key demographics that your target market might include?

3. Come up with a business plan and marketing strategy that will make your product or service available to as many people as possible. This will require scratchbuilding and/or some creativity - but it's important to have a plan in place if you want to make your idea a reality.
