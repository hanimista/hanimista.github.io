Conclusion: What are the benefits of developing big ideas?
Big ideas are the foundation of great businesses and civilizations. They're a way to think outside the box and come up with new solutions to old problems. With the right tools, big ideas can become realities. Here's how to develop big ideas for your business or organization:
1. Start by thinking about what you want your business or organization to achieve. What are your goals? What do you need to change in order to reach those goals? How will your customers feel if you don't deliver on those goals? What are some potential solutions to problems that you could address?

2. Next, think about who your target audience is. Who should be driving your business or organization forward? Do you want to reach a specific group of people, or do you want everyone who matters in your industry to be able to benefit from what you have to offer?

For example, the title can be assigned a point value of 100, while the subtitle could be assigned a point value of 10. The main points and conclusions should also have a point value of 10. 
The following are some examples:

2) The Big Ideas should be well-written and concise. 
3) The Big Ideas need to be relevant to the topic at hand. 
4) It is important that the Big Ideas are logically connected with each other.
