Invention as an act or process: What are some examples?
There are many examples of Invention as an act or process. Sometimes people invent things just because they think they can and sometimes people invent things to help others. Inventors often have a vision for what they want their invention to be, and they work towards making that vision a reality. Some examples of Invention include: 
1) Wiring diagrams: Many inventions are born of need, like the Telephone. Mechanical engineers had been working on creating electrical wiring diagrams for centuries before Alexander Graham Bell came up with the idea for theTelephone.
2) The computer: Inventions like the transistor and laser were all born from necessity - computers did not exist until after WWII because scientists could not build them on a large scale.
3) The airplane: Wright brothers flew airplanes in 1903 without any assistance from anyone else!

The Power of Ideas: Why having a good idea is important.
There's no doubt that having a good idea is important. Ideas are the lifeblood of any business or organisation - without them, you simply wouldn't have anything to offer customers or clients. But what makes a good idea? And how can you make sure that your ideas are as strong as they can be?
A good idea needs to be original and relevant to your target audience. It should also be something that you're passionate about, as this will help you to sell it and get others on board with it. Finally, it's worth considering whether your idea is feasible and practical - if it's not, then it might not be worth pursuing.

If you've got a great idea, then don't be afraid to share it with others.
