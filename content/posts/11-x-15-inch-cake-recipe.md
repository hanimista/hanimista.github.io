Differential value for art: What matters to individuals?
Creative art is one of the most subjective things a person can have. Some people enjoy looking at intricate designs or exploring different colors and textures, while others find pieces with simple designs more compelling. There isn’t one right way to look at art, and it doesn’t matter what someone’s individual values are. The important thing is that someone enjoys creative art, regardless of their individual beliefs.
