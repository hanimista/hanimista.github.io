Discussion: What could we do to improve our idea process?
New ideas often come about during brainstorming sessions, and can be a great way to improve our idea process. However, it can be difficult to come up with new ideas on your own. Here are three tips on how to get started:
1. Get feedback from others: When brainstorming, it’s important to take input from other members of the team. This will help you develop ideas that are both based on common interest and workable.

2. Be open to change: sometimes the best ideas don’t fit into what we’ve been told before. Be willing to change your opinion if something seems better or more feasible.

3. Be persistent: despite sometimes being frustrating, nothing is more important than making sure our idea is implemented successfully. Keep at it until you have a great list of proposals that everyone is happy with!

How Innovation Can Benefit Your Business: from Cut Costs to Higher Productivity
Innovation is the process of coming up with new ways to do something. It can help businesses cut costs and increase productivity, but there are a few considerations that businesses should make before implementing innovation. First, innovation can be risky - if it doesn't work out, it can cost a lot of money and time to fix. Second, some innovations may not be appropriate for every business - if they're not well-suited to your company's culture or mission, you may find that they don't work as well in the long run. Finally, it's important to remember that innovation often requires time and effort - if you don't take the necessary steps to implement it properly, you could see marginal results for a longer period of time.
