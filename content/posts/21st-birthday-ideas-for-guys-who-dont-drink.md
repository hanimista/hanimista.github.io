Patent applications: What are the most common types of patent applications?
Patent applications are the single most common type of document filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). They account for about 60% of all patent filings, and they are also the most popular type of application.
There are many different types of patent applications, but three main types are: utility patents, design patents, and copyrights. Each has its own specific benefits and drawbacks, so it's important to understand which type is best for your product or idea.
