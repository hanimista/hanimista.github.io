Analysis: How can you use big ideas to improve your business or life?
Big ideas are those which are so large and complex that they can be difficult to put into practice but could be very beneficial for your business or life. There are a number of ways to use big ideas, depending on the situation and your business goals. Here are 8 tips to help you get started:
1. Look at thebigpicture:arrows/bigpicture-left.jpg

When you have this overview in mind, it becomes easier to come up with specific steps that need to be taken in order to reach your goal.

The Process of Being Creative
When it comes to creative ideas, the process can be a bit mysterious. Where do they come from? How can you get more of them? While there's no one answer to these questions, there are some things you can do to increase your chances of having a great idea.
First, make sure you're exposing yourself to new things. Ideas often come from seeing something in a new way or combining two disparate things. If you're stuck in the same old routine, it'll be harder to have those "a-ha!" moments.

 Second, give yourself time and space to daydream. Once you have an idea, it's important to let it percolate for a while before taking action on it. Often, the best ideas come when you're not actively trying to think of one.

Finally, don't be afraid to experiment and take risks.
