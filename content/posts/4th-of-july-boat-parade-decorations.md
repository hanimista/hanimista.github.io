Protectionism: How has protectionism affected invention propagation?
Protectionism has had a significant impact on the propagation of invention ideas. Invention ideas often originate from a new perspective or idea that is not protected by current legislation. Protectionism can stop these new perspectives from reaching a wider audience, and it can also limit the number of products that can be created based on an idea.

The power of imagination:
Creativity is a key aspect of any person’s life, and in some cases, it can be the spark that ignites an idea. For others, creativity may be something they are born with or something they learn how to use. Regardless of what creative ability someone has, there is always room for improvement. Here are four ways to use imagination to your advantage: 
1. As a tool for problem-solving. When you have an idea but no idea how to bring it to life, imagine doing it yourself. This can help you come up with solutions that seem impossible until you try them out.

2. As an inspiration for creativity. People have different styles and preferences when it comes to art, so by imagining what another artist might do or say, you can get ideas for your own work that would otherwise be hard to come by.

The process of invention: Outline the steps that are involved in creating something new.
1. The process of invention generally starts with an idea. This could be something that you come up with yourself, or something that you see in the world around you.
2. Once you have an idea, the next step is to start working on it. This involves developing the idea further and turning it into a plan or a prototype.

3. The next stage is to test your invention. This could involve making sure it works as intended, or testing it out on a small scale before launching it onto the market.

4. Finally, once you're satisfied with your invention, it's time to commercialize it and bring it to the world. This involves marketing your invention and getting people to use it or buy it.
