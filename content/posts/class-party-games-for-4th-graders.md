Commercialization of an invention: What happens next?
Invention ideas are an important part of any business. They can be used to create new products or services, or to improve current ones. But what happens when these ideas are commercialized?

Conclusion: How to develop big ideas effectively.

To landscape a new garden, for example, it is important to understand the different types of plants and what they will grow in. To develop a plan for an office remodel, employees need to understand the different needs of each room and how best to layout them so that everyone has their space. 

 Big ideas come in all shapes and sizes, but they all have one common goal: making your project more likely to succeed. With practice, you can develop the ability to identify and capitalize on these opportunities.
