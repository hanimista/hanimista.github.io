Tips for improving the appearance of your home
Looking to improve the appearance of your home? Here are a few tips to help!
1. Make use of natural light - All homes benefit from natural light, whether they're for sleeping or working in. In order to create this light, start by using windows and doors that open freely, and then keep your curtains and window treatments open.

2. Be creative - Not all home improvement projects are created equal. If you're looking to spruce up your space with some new decorating ideas, be sure to take into account what's important to you and what you can do with minimal effort. Try focusing on details like draperies or fabrics instead of overly-large changes.

3. Use common sense - When it comes to home decoration, be aware of the pitfalls that can often lead to a less-than-appealing final product.

brainstorming: How do you come up with invention ideas?
Do you ever come up with ideas for products or services without knowing what they are? Or how to start thinking about them? In this article, we'll discuss brainstorming - the process of coming up with invention ideas.
There are a few different ways to brainstorm: by yourself, with a partner, or with a team. When brainstorming, it's important to be organized and have an idea hierarchy in mind.
