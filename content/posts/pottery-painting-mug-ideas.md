getting feedback: How do you get feedback for your creative ideas?
Creative ideas are a great way to get feedback for your work. However, getting feedback can be difficult. There are a number of ways to get feedback and it depends on the person you are talking to. Here are some tips:
1. Take notes when you have thoughts or ideas. This will help you remember what you want to say later and also give you feedback on how your idea is sounding.

2. Get someone else to listen to your ideas. If you only have yourself to talk to, it can be tough getting feedback because it may not be clear what is wanted from the conversation. Get someone else who will understand the idea and can give feedback that is helpful.

3. Talk about your ideas with others before starting anything new.

How to get started with creative ideas: What should you do first?
Creative ideas are a key part of any business or creative project. However, getting started can be difficult. Here are four tips to help you get started:
1. Look at your goals 
First, ask yourself what kind of creativity you want to achieve. Do you want to create new ideas, or simply improve on old ones? If your answer is "both," look for ways to combine your two skills. Are you interested in creating products, services, or designs? Then look into Lynda.com and online resources such as Illustrator and Photoshop for help.
2. Get organized 
Once you have a basic idea of what you want to accomplish, it's time to start thinking about how to achieve it. Try creating a timeline/schedule for your project and working with someone else who can help guide you along the way.

Other Ideas: How do you go about thinking of other creative ideas?
Creative ideas come in all shapes and sizes, but they all have one common goal: to improve the process of thinking. Here are a few tips on how to consider other creative ideas:
1. Look at your current work and ask yourself what you can improve. What are the areas that need improvement? How can you make those improvements?
2. Brainstorm with a group of people. When you come up with new ideas, it can be helpful to have others involved. Why not group together and brainstorm some potential solutions to problems you're currently facing? This will help you to formulate new ideas more effectively.
3. Take a step back and think about your goals. Once you've identified some areas that need improvement, what do you want to achieve with your change? What kind of results do you envision for your new efforts?

The benefits of big ideas
Big ideas are the life blood of any business. They provide a new idea or solution to a problem that can create new opportunities or generate new revenue. Big ideas are what drive innovation and creativity, and they can help companies grow and succeed. Here are four benefits of big ideas:
1. They inspire others to think differently about their own deeds and possibilities.

When someone has a big idea, it takes the pressure off them to come up with something original and exciting. This opens up more opportunities for discussion and collaboration, which can lead to better ideas and faster progress. It also gives people an incentive to take risks and push boundaries, which can lead to even more innovative products or services.

2. They foster team spirit.

Big ideas promote teamwork by giving everyone a chance to contribute in a meaningful way.
