The history of brainstorming
Few things in business are as essential as brainstorming. Whether you’re a team of two or a multinational corporation, being able to come up with new ideas is the key to success. But where did this process come from? How did it evolve into the powerhouse it is today?
The origins of brainstorming can be traced back to the early 1900s. American engineer Alex Osborn was looking for a way to increase creativity and productivity in his advertising agency. He came up with a simple but effective solution: get a group of people together in a room and have them bounce ideas off each other. Osborn called this process “brainstorming” and it quickly caught on.

Since then, brainstorming has undergone something of a renaissance.
