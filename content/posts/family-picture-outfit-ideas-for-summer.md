The Problem/Solution: How do you come up with an idea?
There is no one-size-fits-all answer to the question of how to come up with an idea, but following a few simple steps can help. First, identify what you want to create. This can be anything from a new product to a new way of doing something. Next, think about what others may have done or seen that would inspire you. If you have this kind of inspiration, you can begin working on your idea by imagining what people might be able to do with your product or service. Finally, come up with ways to make your idea even better. By doing this, you will not only increase the chances that your product or service will be successful, but also give yourself the opportunity to improve on any mistakes that may have been made in the early stages of development.

2020: How do we make sure that our 2020 election is fair?
In 2020, the United States will face another harsh election season. Key issues that will be debated include how to make sure that the election is fair and what measures can be taken to prevent fraud. Here are four ideas for making sure that the 2020 election is fair: 
1. Create a public database of all registered electors in order to help ensure accuracy and transparency. This would help reduce voter fraud and make it easier for voters to check whether their ballot has been cast correctly. 
2. Increase the number of voting machines from precincts to whole neighborhoods so that more people can vote in one voting place rather than scattered throughout various precincts. This would improve security and ensure that all ballots are counted accurately. 
3. Make it easier for citizens with disabilities to vote by offering identification requirements or waiving residency requirements in certain cases.

Invention and technology have brought many benefits over the years, including making life easier and improving our quality of life.

Layout: How can you make your living space more organized and comfortable?
Organizing your home can help you feel more comfortable and organized. There are many ways to do this, so find one that works best for you. Here are some ideas:
-Start by taking a look at what is already in your home and take down anything that isn't necessary. This will make room for new things and make your living space more organized.

-Create a basic organizational system for your home with drawers, shelves, boxes, and folders. You can use these to store clothes, tools, or other belongings.

-Expand the idea of organization by adding another level of complexity. For example, you could add removable dividers between rooms or add built-in shelving to main walls. This will give your living space more depth and organization without costing a lot of money.
