What are some creative ideas?
There are endless creative ideas to come up with, and the best way to find them is by brainstorming with a group of people. Here are eight creative ways to spark your imagination: 
1. Start a blog and write about anything that crosses your mind. This can be your personal thoughts or something you read in the news. You don’t have to be perfect – just share what’s on your mind!

2. Draw inspiration from nature and start painting scenes from around town or in your backyard. Add some animal characters for added fun!

3. Get organized and make a list of all the things you want to do before you die (or at least before you retire). Once you have a complete list, it will be easier to prioritize what’s most important.
