Commercialization of Inventions: How do you go about commercializing an invention?
Commercialization of inventions is a complicated and time-consuming process that often depends on the invention's potential market. There are a number of ways to commercialize an invention, but the process most likely to be successful is through licensing or technology transfer agreements. Licensing allows for a company to gain exclusive rights to use an invention, which can lead to large profits. Technology transfer agreements allow companies to share technology with other companies in order to create new products or services. These agreements can lead to large profits for the company involved as well as increased innovation and product competitiveness.

Brainstorming: techniques for generating ideas
Generating ideas can be a daunting task, whether you’re starting a new project or looking for ways to improve an existing one. But with a little creativity and some structure, the process can be much less intimidating.
Here are a few brainstorming techniques that can help you generate ideas:

1. Brainstorming with someone else. Collaborating with someone else can help stimulate new ideas and perspectives that you may not have thought of on your own.

2. Use prompts. If you’re struggling to come up with ideas on your own, prompts can be a helpful way to get the creative juices flowing. You can use prompts from books, online resources, or even make up your own.

3. Take a walk. Sometimes the best way to come up with new ideas is to take a break from thinking about it altogether.

In a time where there are ever-changing ideas and technologies, it is important for businesses to have an idea for their product or service that they can market and sell. Some new ideas are born out of necessity, such as in the case of a product that needs to be small enough to carry without being cumbersome, but too large or expensive to create a viable business model around. Other ideas may come from looking at what others are doing and seeing how they could be improved.
