The 4 Types of Ideas: Objectives: What is the end goal? Creative: How do you come up with the idea? Imaginary: What could be possible? Fantastical: Is this really happening or is it a dream? Practical: How would this work in reality? futuristic: What if this happened in the future?
Ideas are a necessary part of any business or project. They can be used to come up with solutions to problems or to create new ideas. However, they can also be used for evil purposes. Some people use ideas as tools to manipulate others, while others use them as vehicles for their own creativity. 
The different types of objectives you might come up with in order to create an idea are imaginary, fantastic, and possible. Imaginary objectives are where you forget the end goal or what the final outcome will be. Fantastical objectives are where you think about things that couldn’t actually happen but could still make senses if done in a certain way. Finally, is objective is where youumberofideasyougeneratedbeforecomingupwiththefinalobjective.

The process of invention: Outline the steps that are involved in creating something new.
1. The process of invention generally starts with an idea. This could be something that you come up with yourself, or something that you see in the world around you.
2. Once you have an idea, the next step is to start working on it. This involves developing the idea further and turning it into a plan or a prototype.

3. The next stage is to test your invention. This could involve making sure it works as intended, or testing it out on a small scale before launching it onto the market.

4. Finally, once you're satisfied with your invention, it's time to commercialize it and bring it to the world. This involves marketing your invention and getting people to use it or buy it.

How do you come up with good ideas?
Ideas are a dime a dozen, but they often have the potential to be great. Here are three tips to come up with good ideas:
1. Take your time – don’t just give up on an idea right away. Start by thinking about it more closely and then coming up with potential ways that it could be improved.

2. Be open to feedback – If you don’t think your idea is good, ask other people for their opinions. This will help you get closer to the best version of your idea.

3. Be persistent – If you keep working on your idea, eventually it will become better.
