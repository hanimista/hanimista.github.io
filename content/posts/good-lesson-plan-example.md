Ideas for transportation: What can we do to improve transportation?
How can we improve transportation? 
There are many ways to improve transportation, but here are some ideas for transportation that could be implemented in 2022.

1. More public transportation: Government and non-profit organizations should work together to create more public transportation. This would help decrease traffic congestion and provide a more efficient way to get around town.
2. Improved bike infrastructure: Bicycles can play an important role in improving transportation, as they are environmentally friendly and easy to ride. Bike lanes should be built in major cities so people can easily access the rest of the city without having to navigate through traffic. 
3. Electric vehicles: Electric vehicles have many potential benefits for transportation, including reducing pollution and saving money on fuel expenses.
