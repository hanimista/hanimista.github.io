The history of invention: From the ancient Greeks to the present day
Inventions have a long and varied history, starting with the ancient Greeks. They were credited with developing many of the classic inventions such as the bow and arrow, pottery, and democracy. However, the modern era of invention has seen some significant advances, such as Apple’s iPhone and Google’s Street View. This article concentrates on three main invention ideas – air travel, automobiles, and satellite TV – but there are others that have long been inching towards becoming common knowledge.

2nd idea:
If you're stuck on what to do next, don't worry—you're not alone. We all have moments where we feel uninspired, whether it's in our personal lives or our work. The good news is, there are plenty of ways to get your creative juices flowing again.
Here are a few ideas to get you started:

1. Take a break: Sometimes the best way to get out of a rut is to take a break. Get up and walk around, take a nap or just step away from your work for a little while. You may find that when you come back, you have a fresh perspective and can approach your project with new energy.

2. Talk to someone: When you're feeling lost, talking to someone who is creative can give you some great ideas.

What makes a good idea?
Every idea has a differentiator and what makes a good one is always subjective. Some people might find the concept interesting, others might not. There are many factors to consider when choosing an idea, such as how well it will be executed, who will be using it, and whether it is something that users are already passionate about. 
One of the most important things to consider when coming up with ideas is whether or not they are big enough to warrant investment. If an idea is too small or unimportant to warrant attention, it will likely be forgotten or passed over. A good example of this was the iPhone app Gap which was only released in Australia but contained massive potential because users were already interested in fashion and had tonnes of feedback. Another example would be Square which was originally considered a payment platform but has since become a popular social media platform for businesses and individuals.

Ideas are what makes us human. They drive our creativity, give us new ways to think, and motivate us to do things we might not otherwise consider. In a world filled with so much noise and information, ideas can be a precious commodity. Without them, we would be lost in a sea of complacency or boredom.

Creativity is a vital part of any work. Without creativity, there would be no point to starting a project and wouldn't be anything to look forward to during the process. However, getting inspiration for one's work can be difficult. There are many ways to get inspiration, but it all comes down to finding what works for you and your personal style. Here are some tips on how to get inspired for your next project:
