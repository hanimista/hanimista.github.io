What are creative ideas?
Creative ideas can be anything from a new way of looking at an old problem, to coming up with a new business idea. Whether you’re brainstorming for your next project or just need a break from reality, creative ideas can help you get anything done. So what are some of your favorite creative ideas? Here are a few examples: 
1) Taking things one step further: When you come up with an original idea, don’t stop there. What could the world do with another perspective? Try taking something that people usually do and make it their own. This will give your idea more life and make it more unique. 
2) Breaking the mold: When it comes to business, there is no “safe” route when it comes to starting a company.
