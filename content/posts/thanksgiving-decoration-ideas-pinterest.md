Ideas: 1. New ways to think about sex and relationships.
There is a growing number of new ideas about sex and relationships that are designed to make both men and women happier and more satisfied. Here are some of the most popular suggestions:
1. Sex can be viewed as something that should be enjoyed, not just done. This means that it should be an intimate experience that is both enjoyable and satisfying for both partners.

2. One way to create a more fulfilling sexual relationship is by setting clear boundaries with each other early on. This includes setting expectations for what will happen during sex, how much time each person will want to spend together, and what kind of communication needs to be established in order to ensure smooth sailing.

3. Sex should not only be about making love but also about getting pregnant and having children together.
