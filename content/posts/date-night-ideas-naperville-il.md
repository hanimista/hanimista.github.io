What are some of the benefits of blogging?
Blogging can be a great way to share your ideas, thoughts and feelings with the world. Not only can you connect with others who are interested in the same things you are, but you can also build relationships with them and learn from them. There are a number of benefits to blogging that include: 
1) You can communicate more effectively – when you have a consistent flow of content, your readers will be able to see what you’re trying to say without having to read every sentence. This will help you to sounds smarter and more articulate when it comes time for debates or speeches. 
2) You can build up an audience – by sharing your voice with others, you’re opening yourself up to new people who might be interested in what you have to say. This could lead to new customers or opportunities for marketing campaigns.
