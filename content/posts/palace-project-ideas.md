1. Idea Submission: How do you go about submitting an idea?
When you want to submit an idea to a news outlet, there are a few things you need to do in order to make sure your submission is accepted.

Once your idea has been edited and approved by staff at the outlet, you will then need to promote and sell your submission to potential customers.
