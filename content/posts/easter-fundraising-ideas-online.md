History of Invention: How did inventors come up with new ideas?
Invention ideas come from many different sources, but the most common origins are as a result of inspiration or thought. Inventions can come in many forms- from simple devices to complex machines. Sometimes, an idea for a new product is born out of pure boredom or curiosity. Other times, an inventor may simply have the perfect solution to a problem that he or she has been experiencing. Whatever the case may be, history has shown that inventors often come up with new ideas based on their own experiences and observations.
