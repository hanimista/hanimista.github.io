Causes and Solutions: How can we improve our overall health by understanding why some things are causing us problems, and what can be done to fix them?

Unfortunately, not everyone understands why some things are causing them problems, and so they don't take the necessary steps to fix them.

To improve overall health, we need to understand the root causes of these problems and take the necessary steps to fix them. Here are five key ideas to help you do just that: 
1) Understand your triggers: every time you experience an unpleasant or stressful event (like getting a new job), your body releases chemicals like glutamate from the brains cells in response. These chemicals can cause pain signals to be sent directly to your brain stem.
