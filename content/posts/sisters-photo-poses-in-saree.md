The history of innovation
Innovation is not a new concept. It has been around since the beginning of time. The first instance of innovation was when early man used a sharpened rock to make a spear. This allowed him to kill animals for food and protect himself from predators. Since then, there have been many other instances of innovation.
The wheel is another example of innovation. It was invented by the Sumerians in Mesopotamia around 3500 BC. The wheel made it possible to transport goods and people over long distances. It also helped to speed up production in factories and workshops.

The printing press is another important invention that has had a major impact on the world. It was invented by Johannes Gutenberg in the 15th century and it made it possible to mass-produce books and other printed materials. This had a huge impact on education and knowledge sharing.

brain washing: How can people be made to do things they don't want to do?
How can people be made to do things they don't want to do? There are many ways, but some of the most common methods are brainwashing and suggestion. Brainwashing is a process of inducing someone to change their views or behavior by using persuasive techniques. suggesting someone does something based on their eagerness or attraction often works better than actual coercion. Brainwashing techniques typically range from subtle (like reinforcing positive thoughts) to blatant (such as convincing someone that they have no choice in the matter). 
There are a few different types of brainwashing, but the most common is suggestion. Suggestion is when you say something that might make someone do something they wouldn't normally do. For example, if you tell a person they have to go outside for 5 minutes, that might suggest to them that it's time for them to get up and leave.
