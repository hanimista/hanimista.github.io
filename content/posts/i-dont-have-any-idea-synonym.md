Effects of innovation on society and businesses: How does innovation impact economic development?
Innovation is a key factor that has had a positive impact on society and businesses over the years. Some of the benefits include increased production, efficiency, and competitiveness. However, there are also potential negative impacts that can arise from innovation. For example, it can lead to new products or services being created that are not as desirable or successful as those that have been before. In addition, it can also lead to changes in the way business is conducted – for example, through the introduction of new methods or tools. This can have a significant impact on company profits and employee productivity.

Invention of the World Wide Web
In 1839, Nicholas-Jacques Conte wrote a paper on the idea of a world wide web, which would eventually be called the Internet. The first real steps were made in 1947 when Claude Shannon and others developed the theory of information theory, which allowed for the Transmission of Information over Communications Channels.
