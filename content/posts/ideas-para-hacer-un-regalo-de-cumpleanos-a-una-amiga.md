How to Choose the Right Painting Scheme for Your Home
There are a lot of things you can do to “paint” your home, but it’s important to choose the right scheme for your needs. A few key factors to consider include: the size of your home, budgeting restrictions, and the style of your home. If you want an artsy home with lots of details or if you want a sleek, modern look, there are many different painting schemes available. Here are some tips on how to pick the best scheme for your home:
1. Decide how much space you want to dedicate to painting. A small home may not need as much room as a larger one, so decide what scheme will work best for you and your budget.

2. Consider how much light and shadow you want in your paintings. Do you need bright colors in every room?

What’s in store for the future of technology?
This year, many articles and presentations were made about the future of technology. The topics ranged from the digital age to artificial intelligence and beyond. However, one thing that was conspicuously absent was any discussion on how technology could impact our social lives. 
It seems that many people are still quite unsure of how technology will have an impact on our daily lives. Some believe that it will only be a force for good, while others remain worried about its ability to divide us further along lines of gender, race, and economic status. Some may even see it as a harbinger of great evil - like in the case of AI becoming self-aware and exploiting humans for their own gain. But whatever the future holds, one thing is for sure: tech will have an important role to play.
