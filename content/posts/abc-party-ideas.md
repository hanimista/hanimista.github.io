Technology: How has technology changed the way we live and work?

For example, I can now watch my favorite show when I’m at home without having to leave my couch. Technology has also allowed us to do things that were once impossible. For example, I can now work from home and get a high-paying job. Technology has also changed the way we think about work. Previously, work was seen as a necessary evil that was bad for our health and soul. However, with technology, work is no longer seen as necessary. Today, many people see work as an opportunity to learn new skills and grow their career.
