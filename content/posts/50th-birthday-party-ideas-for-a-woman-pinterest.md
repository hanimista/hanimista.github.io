Defining big ideas
There are a lot of big ideas out there. But what exactly are they? And how can we define them?
A big idea is an overarching concept or theme that is central to a work of art, literature, or philosophy. It is usually something that the author wants to communicate to the audience, and it can be interpreted in many ways.

One way to think of a big idea is as a symbol or motif that represents something larger than itself. For example, in the novel The Great Gatsby, the green light on Daisy Buchanan’s dock represents hope and possibility. In Shakespeare’s play Romeo and Juliet, the balcony scene is a symbol of young love and its potential for tragedy.

Another way to define a big idea is as an abstract concept that can be explored in different ways.

The Creative Process: How does one go about coming up with creative ideas?
Creative ideas can come from anywhere, but the creative process typically starts with an idea. This idea is typically something that has been on someone’s mind for a while, but they have never had a good way to bring it to fruition. The creative process starts by sorting through all of the options and trying to find the best one for the project at hand. Next, the team needs to come up with a rough plan for how they will execute the idea. Once everything is set in stone, it’s time for creativity to take over!
