What is innovation?
The word "innovation" is often used to describe a new or different idea, product, or service. However, what is innovation really? Is it just a new way of doing something? Or is it something more significant, like the creation of a new kind of economy?
Innovation can be anything from the creation of a new kind of fuel to the development of a new type of clothing. It's an important part of our economy and helps us improve our lives.

what is creativity?
What is creativity? It’s a question that has been asked throughout history, and one that still stumps us today. There are many definitions of creativity, but at its core, creativity is about generating new ideas.
It’s not just about coming up with crazy, out-of-the-box ideas (although that can be part of it). Creativity can also be about finding new ways to solve problems or approaching tasks in a different way.

So why is creativity important? For one, it’s essential for innovation. Without creativity, we wouldn’t have any new products, technologies or ideas. And in a world that’s constantly changing and evolving, we need to be able to adapt and come up with new solutions to keep up.

Creativity is also important for our mental health.
