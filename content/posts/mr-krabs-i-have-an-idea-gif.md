Invention as a technology: What are some of the different types of inventions?
Invention is the process of creating something new from something that someone already has. There are three main types of inventions: physical, mental, and economic. Physical inventions involve putting things together to make something new. Mental inventions involve changing how people think or behaving. Economic inventions involve making a product or service more affordable for others.

Commercialization of an invention: What happens next?
Invention ideas are an important part of any business. They can be used to create new products or services, or to improve current ones. But what happens when these ideas are commercialized? In some cases, this can lead to great wealth for the inventor and their backers, while in others it can lead to negative consequences for the company or product. Here is a look at three examples:
1. Apple Inc.'s invention of the iPhone led toohlseaGapps (AIG) being created as a direct competitor, which in turn led to Apple getting greater profits and market share.

2. Microsoft's invention of the Windows operating system led to its rivals making versions that were more secure and easier to use than the original versions. This caused a decline in Redmond's market share and caused some criticism from users who felt they had not been given a fair chance.
