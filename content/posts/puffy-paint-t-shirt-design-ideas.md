Brainstorming techniques
When it comes to brainstorming, there are a variety of techniques that can be used in order to generate new ideas. One popular technique is known as brainwriting, which involves writing down ideas on paper or in a digital document. This can be done individually or in a group setting.
Another common brainstorming technique is known as mind mapping. This involves creating a visual representation of ideas, often using colors and images. This can help to stimulate the creative part of the brain and can be used to organize thoughts in a more logical manner.

Lastly, brainstorming can also be done through problem-solving techniques such as SCAMPER. This acronym stands for Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to other uses, Eliminate, and Reverse/Rearrange.
