Future of work: What ways will technology impact the way we work?
Technology is constantly evolving, so the future of work is always in question. Some ideas that could impact the way we work include:1) Virtual assistant technology – This could eventually allow people to work remotely and then receive help when they need it.2) Augmented reality – This could be used to improve efficiency by giving employees more information at a glance.3) Artificial intelligence – This is being developed to help with tasks that are too difficult or time-consuming for humans to do.4) Robot assistants – These can be used for tasks that are too dangerous or time- consuming for humans to do, such as cleaning or laundry.5) Driverless cars – These cars don’t have drivers, so employees would no longer have to worry about getting lost in the traffic.6) Collaborative working environment – This would involve employees working together towards a common goal instead of individually.

Overcoming barriers to big thinking
It's no secret that some of the world's most successful people are also some of the world's biggest thinkers. But what separates these individuals from everyone else?
For starters, they're not afraid to think big. They don't let their imaginations be limited by what's considered "normal" or "possible." Instead, they allow themselves to explore every possibility, no matter how far-fetched it may seem.
