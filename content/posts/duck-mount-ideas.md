What are the benefits of Blogging?
There are many benefits to blogging, including creating an online presence for your business, sharing your thoughts and ideas with others, and deepening the connection you have with your customers or followers. Here are four of the most popular benefits of blogging: 
1. Increased Visibility: When you start blogging, you become one of the “official” authors of your blog post. This gives other bloggers a higher chance of finding and reading your content, as well as potential customers who may be interested in what you have to say. 
2. Increased Exposure: Your blog posts will be seen by more people than if you wrote them all from scratch. Not only will this give you an audience that can potentially promote your brand or product, but it also leads to increased traffic and for website owners, more leads coming in from potential customers.
