Invention history: How did some of the earliest inventions get started?
Inventions have a long and complicated history, with some getting started much earlier than others. Here are some of the most notable inventions, starting with the oldest:
The first true computer was built in the late 17th century by Johannes Gutenberg, who used a printing press to create movable type. The printing press had potential to spread literacy and knowledge far beyond the small town where Gutenberg resided.

Invention ideas are often hatched out of boredom or frustration. In 1823, Charles Babbage designed a machine that could solve problems in mathematics that had never been solved before. The machine was code-named Analytical Engine and it was not completed until 1831.

But even the earliest machines didn’t always get results they were hoping for.

How to be more creative
Creativity is key to any business. By being creative, you can come up with new ideas that can solve problems or come up with new strategies for winning customers. However, if you don’t have creative ideas yourself, it can be difficult to find those that will work for your business. Here are nine tips on how to be more creative: 1) Be open to new ideas. Don’t be afraid to experiment and try different ways of thinking. 2) Be persistent. The more you try, the better chance you have of success. 3) Take time for yourself. Whether it’s outside activities like painting, hiking or reading, make sure you have time for yourself so you can relax and get lost in your work. 4) Find a collaborator.

Citation: How should an inventor be cited?
An inventor should be cited when creating or referencing a work in any form, whether it be in an academic article, book, thesis, or patent application. Citing an inventor correctly can improve the accuracy and legibility of your work, as well as prevent others from plagiarizing your invention. To properly cite an inventor, follow these simple steps:
1. Identify the inventor(s) responsible for your invention. This can be done by finding their name and contact information on patents or other sources that list inventors.

2. Research the specific invention you are referencing to try to determine which author wrote about that invention specifically. If you're referencing a work written by several authors, it's often helpful to identify which author wrote about each innovation in order to better understand how they could have been cited for this particular innovation.
