Creative tools: What are they?
Creative tools, or tools that can help you be creative, are anything from a tool to help you brainstorm ideas to software that can help with creating art or designs. Here are 8 of the most common creative tools:
1. A spiral notebook – A spiral notebook is perfect for colorful and innovative ideas, as well as for taking sketches and ideas to paper. You’ll love using a spiral notebook as your creative tool because it makes it easy to jot down ideas and keep track of what you’ve been working on. Plus, Spiral notebooks are great for organized creativity because they come in different sizes and widths.

2. A whiteboard – A whiteboard is another great way to get started in your creative process. Just like spiral notebooks, whiteboards come in different shapes and sizes so you can find one that fits your needs perfectly.

Idea for a big goal: What is our biggest goal?
Big goals are powerful tools for getting people to work together and achieve common goals. They can help a team focus on its mission, and create a sense of purpose. 
There are many different ways to create big goals, but here are five tips for creating effective ones: 

1. Start small: Big goals can be created relatively easily if the goal is something that the team is focused on and knows it has a chance of achieving. However, if the goal is something more difficult or time-consuming, it may be more difficult to get everyone together around it. Try starting with something that everyone in the team can understand and achieve. 

2. Break it down: Once the goal has been identified, break it down into smaller tasks that each team member can complete successfully.

Prototype is a term that is often used in the industry to describe a preliminary version of an invention. It can also be used more generally to describe any form of product or service development.
