Product/Service sections: What problems do you think need to be solved in order to make a better product or service?
There are a number of things that need to be solved in order to make a better product or service. One area where new ideas could help is in the area of customer service. Many people feel that the service that they receive when purchasing a product is not up to par and this is especially true when it comes to online services. This problem needs to be addressed in order for people to feel confident with their purchase. Another issue that needs to be solved is with the way products are offered.

The definition of creativity
Creativity is a mental process which refers to the ability to come up with new ideas, solutions or products. It can be described in different ways but ultimately it is what makes us unique and makes us stand out from the rest. Creative art is often seen as an area where creativity flourishes, as it offers an escape from reality and allows people to become creative problem solvers. In order to be considered creative, an artist must have a strong imagination, be able to see things in a new light and be willing to experiment.

The 4 types of creativity: Intrinsic, extrinsic, creative accident, and creative process.
Creative process is the sum total of all the steps that go into producing a work of art. Intrinsic creativity comes from within; extrinsic creativity is based on external factors, such as the environment or the people around someone. Creative accidents happen when something goes wrong while trying to create something, usually resulting in a new and different way of looking at things. The creative process is a never-ending journey, and it can be unpredictable.
