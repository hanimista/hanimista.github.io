Differences between creative visual and auditory artists: Visual artists typically paint or sculpt while auditory artists listen to music or read books. Kinesthetic artists may use their body to create works of art. Gustatory artists may choose flavors or smells to add
Visual artists typically paint or sculpt while auditory artists listen to music or read book. While the two mediums have certain similarities, there are also significant differences that can make a difference in the way an artist creates their work. For example, visual artists often use colors and shapes to create patterns and images while auditory artists often listen to music or read books as sources of inspiration. Additionally, visual artists may use more abstract techniques while auditory artists may prefer more realistic portrayals of their subjects.
