Prototyping: How to prototype your invention idea
If you have an invention idea, there are several ways you can go about prototyping it. One way is to create a model of your invention. This can be done by hand or using computer-aided design software. Another way to prototype your invention is to create a working prototype. This involves actually building a working version of your invention. You can also create a mockup of your invention. This is a non-working replica of your invention that can be used for marketing or testing purposes.
