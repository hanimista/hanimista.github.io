What is invention?
Invention is an act or process of coming up with a new solution to a problem. Invention has come from many different places, including science, business and creativity. Today, invention is used more often in technology than it ever has been before. 
Invention can be something as simple as making a new product or service or taking an idea and turning it into a reality. Sometimes invention comes from the simplest things- like coming up with a better way to chop wood. Other times, it takes longer but is more complex- like coming up with a new way to print money or create new ways to store information. 

But whatever the case, when someone comes up with an innovative solution, that’s something special. It shows they have think outside the box and are willing to try somethingnew just to see if it works.

Implementation: What are the steps involved in developing a big idea?
When it comes to big ideas, implementation is key. In order to put your big idea into action, you'll need to have a clear plan and follow the steps involved in developing it. Here are some key things to keep in mind: 
1. Have a strong idea - before you can develop a plan for implementation, you need a strong idea of what you want your big idea to achieve. this may include laying out a clear vision or goal, answering key questions about what users would need and desires, and designing an MVP or Minimum Viable Product that showcases your concept. 
2. Develop an MVP - Once you have a strong idea of what your big idea is, it's time to develop an MVP or Minimum Viable Product that showcases it. This will help validate your hypothesis and get user feedback so that you can continue developing the product with greater confidence.

Conclusion: What are some things to keep in mind when trying to achieve creative goals?
Creative goals can be anything from making a beautiful piece of art to designing a new product. There are several things to keep in mind when trying to achieve creative goals. One important thing to keep in mind is that you should always aim for the best possible outcome. If you do not care about the end result, then your creativity will likely not be productive. Another important thing to consider when trying to achieve creative goals is how you plan on achieving them. Do not try to accomplish too many things at once, as this will likely lead to frustration and further planning problems. Lastly, do not forget that creativity does not have to come from inside yourself – it can also come from outside sources. When looking for inspiration, look for stories or articles that might help jog your memory and create new ideas.
