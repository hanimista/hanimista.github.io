The Top 5 Diy Ideas for House Cleaning
1. Make a simple cleaning routine: daily sweeping, dusting, mopping, and vacuuming will help keep your home clean and free of dirt and dust mites.
2. Use an all-natural cleaner: certain ingredients can help remove dirt and other stains from surfaces without harsh chemicals.
3. Add a touch of Grace: think about ways to add personality to your home with furniture or decor that is fresh and new.
4. Keep your windows clear: use a screen protector or window cleaner to keep the view looking great while keeping particles out of the glass panes.
5. Add some whimsy: consider adding wacky little accessories to your home like jester hats or incenses to give it a whimsical feel.

What is innovation?
Innovation is a process of creating new products, services, or ideas that are different from the ones that have been before. It can be called creative change, and it can happen in a number of ways: through product development (racting evidence to create a new product), market research (finding out what people want and need), or process improvement (making things easier or faster). Innovation is often about finding solutions to problems that people have never considered before.
