Play: What is play?
Play can mean many different things to different people, and for some, it may be simply taking a break from work or life. To others, play may be something more communal, like exploring new neighborhoods or making new friends. There is no one-size-fits-all definition of what play means to someone, but the important thing is that it is an important part of who we are and what we enjoy.

Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea or design, whether it’s for a product, service, or a new way of doing something. One of the most important aspects of invention is creativity.

Creative process: How does creativity work?
Creativity is often thought of as a process, rather than an event. creativity begins with the idea, and then the creative artist goes on to create something unique and amazing from that idea. This creative process often includes brainstorming, designing, testing, refining, and sometimes even reworking ideas until they are finally created.
