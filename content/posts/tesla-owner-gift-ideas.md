This might be due to a lack of innovation, or it could be because your product is not yet available in an affordable price point. Regardless, make sure you are prepared to face rejection and continue working on your idea until it becomes a reality.

2. Be persistent
It takes a lot of hard work and perseverance to bring your idea to market. However, if you keep at it, you will eventually reach your goals.
