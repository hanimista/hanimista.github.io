Idea 1: Why did this idea come to mind?
This idea came to mind because of my son's 6th grade science project. In it, he was trying to figure out why a bee falls off of a tree. He found that the bee's wings would eventually break and they would fall to the ground. He thought this could be a fun experiment to do with his classmates.

The benefits of big ideas
Big Ideas can have a significant impact on people’s lives and the world around them. By sharing great ideas with the world, we can help make a positive change. Here are 5 of the best big ideas around: 
1. Let people know their options – large groups of people can be very intimidating, especially if you don’t have an idea for something. Let them know there are many different ways to solve a problem and that they don’t have to choose one. This will open their eyes and give them more options. 
2. Give people power – often times, the most important thing is giving people control over their lives in some way shape or form. In order to do this, you need to share your idea with as many people as possible so that everyone has an equal say in what happens next.
