What is brainstroming and how does it work?
There is a lot of debate surrounding the term brainstroming. What is it? And how does it work? The answer to both questions is that brainstroming occurs when people are unfocused or processor-locked. This can lead to a lack of focus and an inability to process information. It’s often difficult to know where to turn or what to do next, which can result in a feeling of emptiness or hopelessness.
Brainstroming is typically accompanied by feelings of helplessness and confusion. People may feel like they don’t have any control over their lives and they don’t know what to do next. This can be a difficult time for both the person with brainstroming and those around them. It’s important for those with brainstroming to seek help if they feel lost or hopeless.
