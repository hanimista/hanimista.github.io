Some people are more creative than others, but everyone has the ability to be creative in some way. There are many different ways to express creativity, such as through art, writing, music, and even problem-solving.

Creativity is often thought of as a rare talent, but with a little practice, anyone can improve their creativity. The next time youâ€™re feeling stuck or uninspired, try brainstorming with a friend or taking on a new challenge. You may be surprised at the results!
