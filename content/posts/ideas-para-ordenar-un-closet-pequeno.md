The computer: How it was invented and how it has changed
In 1876, American inventors Charles Babbage and Herman Hollerith created the first mechanical computers. These early machines were complex and expensive, and they could only be used by trained mathematicians and engineers. In 1937, British mathematician Alan Turing published a paper that described how a machine could be built to perform any type of calculation. Turing's paper inspired many scientists and engineers to begin work on electronic computers. In 1941, German engineer Konrad Zuse designed and built the first programmable computer. The first computers were large, expensive, and used vacuum tubes for circuitry.

Causes of change in the economy and society: Innovation leads to change.
Innovation is always a driving force for change in the economy and society. There are many reasons why innovation can lead to changes in behavior, products, services, and even entire industries. 
Some of the primary reasons for innovation are to help businesses succeed more efficiently and faster; to create new consumer demand; to increase production; and to improve efficiency. 

But there are other factors as well, such as the need for new ideas or approaches when it comes to solving problems or meeting needs. When these come together, they can result in radical change in an industry or society.
