What is brainstroming and what does it do?
Brainstroming is a new way of thinking that promises to change the way we think about intelligence and creativity. It is a form of mental gymnastics that uses brain waves to improve problem-solving skills. The theory behind brainstroming is that by focusing on certain patterns and ideas, we can improve our thinking skills and increase our creativity.
There are already several companies that use brainstroming in their businesses. One company, called Cortex, sells an app called Brainstorm that helps you focus on specific problems and ideas to improve your problem solving skills. Other companies that are using brainstroming include Google, Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft. There is no single answer to how or when brainstroming should be used in business, but there are some key principles to follow if you want to try it out for yourself.
