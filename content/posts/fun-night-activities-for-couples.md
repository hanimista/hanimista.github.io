Inspiration from Others: What sources can you draw from?
If you're looking to up your creative game, take inspiration from others. Whether it's learning new techniques or paying homage to classic pieces, there are endless possibilities out there. Here are a few ideas to get you started: 
Start with old pieces of art. Draw inspiration from both the beauty and functionality of older pieces. Use them as models for your own designs. 

Create a mashup. What if your favorite song was turned into a visual masterpiece? What if each image in your collection was mashed together into one cohesive work? This is what getting on the beaten path is all about – finding orphaned works of art and turning them into something special. 

Inspire yourself with nature. Take a walk in nature and see how different elements impact how you see things.
