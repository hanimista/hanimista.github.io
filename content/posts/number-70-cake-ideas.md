The different types of ideas
Ideas can be classified by how they are approached. There are three main types of ideas: problem, solution, and goal. Problem ideas come up with a unique solution that solves the problem at hand. Solution ideas come up with a new way of doing something that solves the problem, but may not be what was originally proposed. Goal ideas are the final solution to a problem or goal. They come up with a specific plan or destination that is aimed at getting somewhere else.

What are some ideas you have for writing?
1. Start by brainstorming a few ideas for your next writing project. What do you want to say? What does your story tell? How can you create a powerful and memorable experience for your readers?
2. Take some time to read other writer’s work and see what tips or ideas might help you improve your own storytelling skills. What makes their stories so engaging and well-told? Use what you learn to come up with some specific writing advice or tips for your next project.

The benefits of big ideas
Big Ideas can have a significant impact on people’s lives and the world around them. By sharing great ideas with the world, we can help make a positive change. Here are 5 of the best big ideas around: 
1. Let people know their options – large groups of people can be very intimidating, especially if you don’t have an idea for something. Let them know there are many different ways to solve a problem and that they don’t have to choose one. This will open their eyes and give them more options. 
2. Give people power – often times, the most important thing is giving people control over their lives in some way shape or form. In order to do this, you need to share your idea with as many people as possible so that everyone has an equal say in what happens next.

Safe job is not the same as a good job. It may be safe for you to work, but it's not a good job. A safe job is one that does not involve danger, stress, or danger to yourself or others. Keywords: Ideas 202
