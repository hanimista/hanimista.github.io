The different types of innovation: Research, invention, development, and production
Innovation is a process of making something new or different. There are three main types of innovation: Research, Invention, and Development.
Researchinnovation is the most common type of innovation. It's when people study something and then make a change to it so that it can be used in the future. For example, in the medical field, researchers study diseases and then develop treatments to help people with them.

Inventionis when someone comes up with a new idea for something and then does something with it to make it work. For example, somebody might come up with a new way to make cigarettes that doesn't use tobacco smoke as part of their product. 

Developmentis when somebody makes an idea into a reality by creating a product or service that is usable by people.

What are some creative ideas?
Creative ideas come in all shapes and sizes, so it can be hard to know which ones to pursue. Here are some tips on how to find inspiration: 
-Look at what people have already done. This includes looking at art, design, and architecture. Try to see how they have created things that you like and then apply those ideas to your project. 
-Try different methods of creating something new. Use pens, pencils, paper, paints, or clay to create new things. Not everything needs to be composed in words. 
-Think outside the box. Sometimes all you need is a new perspective to start fresh and get inspired.
